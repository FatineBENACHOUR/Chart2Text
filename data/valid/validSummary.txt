In South Korea in 2017 , there were approximately 2.34 doctors for every 1,000 Koreans . This was a slight increase compared to the preceding year , and this ratio has increased steadily since 2000 , exception for a slight drop in 2004 . However , Korea still has few doctors relative to its population . The OECD average was 3.3 doctors per 1,000 people , and among the full OECD member countries , only Turkey had a lower ratio of 1.9 . According to OECD data , only Turkey and the accession candidate Colombia and the key partners , the People 's Republic of China , South Africa , and India have ratios lower than Korea 's . At the other end of the spectrum is Austria with 5.2 doctors per 1,000 people , followed by Norway with 4.8 and Lithuania with 4.6 . Shortage of medical staffs The Korean government officially declared a shortage of several thousand doctors across the nation and recommended the training of an additional 150 doctors every year to make up the shortfall . Furthermore , doctors of traditional Korean medicine are counted among the number of doctors , meaning there are even fewer doctors of modern medical sciences than the official figures suggest . Yet several factors , such as resistance from doctors , prevent the government from simply increasing the number of medical graduates . Regional imbalances in the medical environment Some experts refute the government 's claims that Korea faces a doctor shortage and point towards other factors . For example , Korea has a higher population density than other countries , meaning that the average Korean doctor meets with more patients than an Austrian or Norwegian would , for example . Indeed , half the population is concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area and Koreans see doctors over 20 times a year on average , which is far more frequently than any other OECD nationals . Despite this , Korea spends a lower share of its GDP on medical expenditures than other OECD countries , implying that medical personnel do more work for less financial compensation . Regional disparities where doctors are concentrated in Seoul and other major cities is also an issue . The doctor-to-people ratio in Seoul is higher than the national ratio and the same as the OECD average . Many argue that a shortage of nurses , not because too few are being trained but because many leave because of harsh working conditions , is a greater concern than an alleged shortage of doctors .

Population of Spain While Spain 's fertility rate has been relatively steady over the past decade , its year-over-year population growth has been declining continuously at the same time . A very noticeable plunge was observed from 2008 to 2009 , when population growth was almost halved . Reasons for this decline are manifold , it is speculated that is was caused by the economic crisis taking place simultaneously . The collapse of the job and real estate markets may have led the Spanish to postpone having ( more ) kids or to migrate to other countries in search of a more stable economy . This theory is supported by data on the average age of Spain 's inhabitants ; a look at the median age of Spain 's population from 1950 up until today shows that the Spanish get older on average – perhaps due to the aforementioned factors . Speaking of Spain 's economy , economic key factors suggest that the country is still recovering from the crisis .

Only recently has Spain reported actual GDP growth since 2008 , it remains to be seen if this is going to translate into a positive trend over the next few years .

About 33 percent of U.S. physicians spent 17 - 24 minutes with their patients , according to a survey conducted in 2018 . Physicians are often constrained in their time directly working with patients , which could have an impact on patient care outcomes . Studies found out that physicians spend almost half of their time in office on data entry and other desk work . More sophisticated , network-enabled EHR ( electronic health records ) systems for physicians could probably be a step towards more time directly with patients . U.S. physicians Physicians work in a variety of fields and across direct patient care and research . Within the last 50 years , the total number of active physicians has increased dramatically throughout the United States . Among all U.S. states , including the District of Columbia , the District of Columbia had the highest rate of all U.S. states of active physicians . Physician time In a recent study , physicians were asked about the time they spend with their patients . According to the results , a majority of physicians said that they felt their time with patients was limited . In 2018 , most physicians saw 11 - 20 patients per day . Some reports have estimated that for every hour of direct patient contact , physicians spend an additional 2 hours working on reporting and desk work . Recent physician surveys have also indicated that one of the primary reasons for physician burn-out is having too many bureaucratic tasks .
The statistic shows the growth rate of the real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Japan from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , Japan 's GDP increased by 0.81 percent compared to the previous year . For comparison , the GDP growth rate of China had reached about 7.3 percent that same year.Gross domestic product growth rate in Japan GDP serves as one of the most heavily relied upon indicators to gauge the state and health of a country 's economy . GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a nation 's borders in a given period of time , usually a year . GDP figures allow a more fundamental understanding of a country 's economy . Year-on-year GDP growth acts as a helpful and clear sign of the direction in which a country is moving in economic terms . Real GDP is especially useful and insightful as it takes price changes ( inflation and deflation ) into account . The gross domestic product growth rate in Japan has been shaky since the recession of 2008 struck the world economy like a bolt out of the blue and Japan is still yet to gain a solid foothold . Despite its ongoing financial predicament however , Japan remains one of the world 's most highly developed economies . The economy of Japan is the third largest worldwide by nominal GDP and the nation has a very active manufacturing sector . It is active in the auto manufacturing sector , the third largest in the world after the United States and China , and has an electronics industry that is counted among the worlds most innovative . Japan can boast many titles , but perhaps the most significant to its future stability is that which relates to its astronomical national debts , currently running at over 200 percent of GDP , roughly 10.5 trillion US dollars .
According to a study carried out by Deezer in May 2018 , the most popular genre among Americans was rock music , with 56.8 percent of respondents stating that they were currently listening to music within this genre as of the date of survey . Pop and country music were the second and third most popular genres respectively , and 20.2 percent of respondents said they preferred jazz . The appeal of rock and pop music The broad appeal of rock and pop music can in part be attributed to how both genres often blend seamlessly into one another and influence other music styles . Heavy rock bands like Led Zeppelin and AC/DC are often more divisive than melodic rock groups like Bon Jovi or Genesis , just like pop music which strays into R & B territory or is better associated with hip hop or EDM . Each have their appeal to fans with different tastes , and the versatility of rock and pop ( and music which combines the two ) allows such music to reach adults of all ages and backgrounds . Rock albums also account for the majority of vinyl album sales in the United States , with pop albums ranking second . However , although the resurgence of vinyl has to a certain extent been reliant on the rock genre , this is not the case when it comes to digital music consumption . Rap and hip hop accounted for 22.8 percent of music video streams in the U.S. in 2018 , whereas for rock music videos the share was just 7.1 percent . Rock fared similarly when it came to audio streams , once again losing out to rap and hip hop . Taking such data into consideration , it would seem that rock music fans are generally more drawn to traditional formats and are less inclined to enjoy their music via streaming platforms .

This statistic shows the global platinum metal reserves as estimated as of 2019 , by country . The United States had estimated reserves of around 900 metric tons of platinum metal in 2019 . Platinum is a so called transition metal and one of the rarest elements on Earth . Estimated reserves of platinum metals Total worldwide reserves of platinum metals are estimated to be some 69,000 metric tons . Almost all of it , some 95 percent , is located in the Earth 's crust of South Africa . Far behind it , other major countries are Russia , the United States , and Canada . The United States is estimated to have platinum metal reserves of some 900 metric tons . Platinum in most cases is a by-product of copper and nickel mines and refineries . On the other hand , the largest pure platinum mines are in South Africa , which is also the world 's leading producer of the element . Around 130 metric tons were produced there in 2019 . Russia , as the second largest platinum miner , produced some 22 metric tons . The United States reported a platinum mine production of 3.6 metric tons . The largest platinum miner worldwide is South African mining company Anglo American Platinum Ltd. , headquartered in Johannesburg . Other leading platinum companies are Impala Platinum ( South Africa ) , Sibanye Gold Ltd. ( South Africa ) , and Lonmin ( United Kingdom ) . Since 1901 , the price of platinum has been mostly higher than the price of gold . Platinum is mainly used for vehicle emission control devices and jewelry , but is also in high demand for laboratory devices and as an investment . Through its rarity , platinum became a symbol of prestige , manifesting itself , for example , in platinum awards and platinum credit cards . The crown for the coronation of King George VI of England in 1937 was the first one to be made of platinum .
Global consumption of rice has seen a slight increase over the last several years . In the 2018/2019 crop year , about 490.27 million metric tons of rice was consumed worldwide , up from 437.18 million metric tons in the 2008/2009 crop year . Rice cultivation Rice requires specific growing conditions to be successfully cultivated . It must be grown in a flooded field in several inches of water . Once the unprocessed rice is harvested , it is known as paddy rice . In 2017 , China produced 210.3 million metric tons of paddy rice , making that country the top producer of paddy rice worldwide . India had the largest harvest area of rice in the 2017/2018 crop year , at 43.79 million hectares , while China harvested 30.18 million hectares of rice in that year . Rice trade worldwide In addition to having the largest harvest area of rice , India also was the top exporter of rice in the 2018/2019 fiscal year . During that time period , India exported 12.5 million metric tons of rice . Despite being the top producer of rice worldwide , China 's consumption of rice can not be satisfied by domestic production . China is also the top importer of rice of any country in the world , at over 4.5 million metric tons of rice .
The time series shows the net revenue of Amazon.com 's e-commerce and service sales from 2004 to 2019 , in billion US dollars . In the last reported year , the multinational e-commerce company 's net revenue was 280.5 billion U.S. dollars , up from 177.86 billion US dollars in 2017 .

In recently years , Amazon has also released smartphone , tablets and multimedia sticks under it 's Fire brand in order to increase digital media consumption via these devices . This strategy is connected to the digital Amazon ecosystem which features video and audio content as value-added services for Prime subscribers . Due to its location , Amazon offers more services in North America than worldwide . As a result , the majority of the company 's net revenue in 2019 was actually earned in the United States and Canada . In 2019 , approximately 170.77 billion U.S. dollars was earned in North America compared to only roughly 74.7 billion U.S. dollars internationally .
This statistic represents the average price of bentonite between 2007 and 2019 . In 2019 , the average bentonite price stood at approximately 100 U.S. dollars per ton . Bentonite is a type of clay along with ball clay , common clay , and fire clay . Bentonite – additional informationBentonite is an absorbent aluminum phyllosilicate clay which is frequently generated from the alteration of volcanic ash . It consists predominantly of montmorillonite , a clay mineral . In 1898 , Bentonite was first discovered in 1898 and classified in Fort Benton , Wyoming . Bentonite products have properties which give them a wide and diverse range of uses and applications . Its ability to expand in water is one of its most important properties , giving bentonite its voluminous and gelatinous mass . There are several different types of bentonite , such as , sodium bentonite , calcium bentonite and potassium bentonite . Sodium and calcium bentonites are primarily used for various industrial purposes . In iron and steel production processes , bentonite is widely used as a binding agent . For example , sodium bentonite is commonly used for large castings while calcium bentonite is more often used for smaller castings . The United States was one of the key producers of bentonite in 2016 , followed by China and Greece . In 2019 , the U.S. exported around 820 thousand metric tons of bentonite to other countries.Another common use of bentonite is as a cat litter , due to its advantage of absorbing refuse by forming clumps and leaving the rest of the product for further use . During the period from 1996 through 2014 , bentonite was , by far , the most popular cat litter material used in North America and Europe .

This statistic shows the total population of Greece from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the total population of Greece was around 10.74 million people . Population of Greece After a subtle year-over-year increase from 2004 to 2011 , the population of Greece has experienced a slight drop from 2011 until 2014 . Population growth decreased marginally in 2011 compared to the previous year , and once again in 2012 in comparison to 2011 . Greek women also bore fewer children per woman on average in 2011 , a slight decrease from 2010 . But a lower fertility rate is not necessarily the only reason for the country 's total population decline , Greece 's recent economic downturn also plays a role . Due to poor decisions in regards to spending made by the government , Greece has suffered through an economic crisis since 2010 , diminishing the incentive to live in the country . The unemployment rate dramatically surged since the crisis , reaching a decade high in 2013 . Additionally , the country 's GDP has significantly dropped in the same time frame from 2008 to 2013 , with the largest slump in GDP growth occurring in 2011 . Despite a severe economic slump , Greece still managed to maintain a relatively high HDI value in 2012 , preserving a spot among the top 30 countries worldwide . The HDI , or Human Development Index , is based on parameters such as literacy rate , education levels , GNI and life expectancy , which was one of the highest in the world in 2011 .
Mobile telephones have become increasingly relevant to many aspects of modern life , a phenomenon that is evidenced by the development in the rate of households owning a mobile telephone . Currently , approximately 95 percent of households in the United Kingdom ( UK ) own a mobile phone , a figure that has remained constant since 2015 . That sits in stark contrast with 2000 - 2001 , when less than half of all households in the UK reported owning a mobile telephone . Smartphones leading the charge Given their role as the digital swiss army knife of modern tech , it is no surprise that smartphones are behind much of the growth in this space . Smartphone adoption reached 78 percent during the first half of 2018 , up from 29 percent at the beginning of 2011 . Smartphone ownership drops off steeply for users aged 55 or older , with just 55 percent of residents in that age group reporting that they own a smartphone compared with 95 percent of people aged from 16 to 24 and 25 to 34 years of age . Apple on top The smartphone market is evenly divided between iOS and Android , indicating that Apple is the UK 's preferred smartphone manufacturer . In April 2019 , the iPhone XR , iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 8 claimed 24 percent of the market during April 2019 , taking three of the top five positions .
This graph shows the average number of people per family in the U.S. from 1960 to 2019 . The average American family in 2019 consisted of 3.14 persons . Families in the United States According to the U.S. Census Bureau , a family is a group of two people or more ( one of whom is the householder ) related by birth , marriage , or adoption and residing together ; all such people ( including related subfamily members ) are considered as members of one family . As of 2019 , the U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.48 million families in the United States . The average family consisted of 3.14 persons in 2019 , down from 3.7 in the 1960s . This is reflected in the decrease of children in family households overall . In 1970 , about 56 percent of all family households had children under the age of 18 living in the household . This percentage declined to 40.66 percent in 2019 . The average size of a family household varies greatly from state to state . The largest average families can be found in Utah and Hawaii , with an average of 3.61 members respectively . The smallest families can be found in Vermont and Maine , with an average size of 2.88 and 2.85 members respectively .
This statistic shows the Ukrainian gross domestic product ( GDP ) from 1994 to 2018 in billion U.S. dollars , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , Ukraine 's GDP amounted to approximately 130.86 billion U.S. dollars . See the Russian GDP for comparison . Ukraine 's rocky economy In just two years , between 2013 and 2015 , GDP in Ukraine has been dramatically reduced to half its amount . This very severe decrease is mainly due to the armed conflict in the eastern part of the country , which is causing many of its inhabitants to be internally displaced , and life in general to become increasingly difficult for Ukrainians - not just because of the war , but because the country 's economy is in desperate trouble : The inflation rate has risen to almost 50 percent , the second highest rate around the world behind Venezuela , and unemployment is now at over 11 percent . The industrial Donbass region located to the east of the country has also been devastated . Russia , Ukraine 's most important import and export partner until recently , most likely no longer plays this role , having caused a great shift in the country 's base economy . Ukraine 's national debt in relation to GDP is also unsustainable , having increased by over 50 percent in the last two years . Default or restructuring of its debt was inevitable , and eventually restructuring took place in August 2015 . While the economy is expected to recover somewhat in 2016 , its stability will depend on improving the stability of the country in order to create an environment in which the economy can operate and recover .
This statistic shows the global market share held by Samsung in the smartphone market from the second quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2019 . In the fourth quarter of 2019 , Samsung had a global smartphone market share of 18.8 percent . Samsung 's smartphone market share – additional information The smartphone market has drastically changed since 2009 . Nokia used to lead the industry with almost 50 percent of the smartphone market share in 2007 , but the company 's market presence dropped to nearly three percent in 2013 . Apple and Samsung have remained amongst the top five smartphone vendors in the world since 2009 . Samsung 's Galaxy , first released in 2009 , is their main line of smartphone products , while Apple heavily invests on the iPhone , the company 's primary source of revenue . Samsung 's smartphone market share increased significantly in a time span of three years , going from three percent in the second quarter of 2009 to 32.2 percent in the second quarter of 2012 . None of its competitors have experienced such strong growth in the last few years . As the overall smartphone market grew as well , Samsung was able to maintain its position as global market leader . In 2015 alone , the Korean electronics giant shipped more than 320 million smartphones worldwide , accounting for 21.6 percent of all smartphone shipments worldwide . Samsung shipped more smartphones than Lenovo , Huawei and Xiaomi combined . Apple remains a distant second , with about 216 million iPhones shipped worldwide and around 15 percent of the market share in 2017 .
In 2018 , global mobile data traffic amounted to 19.01 exabytes per month . By 2022 , mobile data traffic is expected to reach 77.5 exabytes per month worldwide at a compound annual growth rate of 46 percent . Mobile traffic Mobile accounts for approximately half of web traffic worldwide . In the first quarter of 2019 , mobile devices ( excluding tablets ) generated 48.71 percent of global website traffic , consistently hovering around the 50 percent mark since the beginning of 2017 . Some regions have wider mobile internet adoption than others . Many developing digital markets are mobile-first , having leapfrogged desktop PC internet due to cost and infrastructural restraints . Asia and Africa have a higher share of mobile web traffic than the global average and in March 2019 , mobile devices accounted for over 73 percent of web traffic in Nigeria . Mobile broadband Mobile video , gaming and app downloads are only a few examples of mobile internet activities that require a mobile broadband connection with sufficient speed . In April 2019 , Norway was ranked first among the countries with the fastest average mobile internet speed . However , the speed of mobile internet connections is one thing , mobile phone network coverage is another . In 2018 , 98 percent of the European population had mobile broadband with only two percent of the population not having mobile broadband coverage . By contrast , the MBB coverage gap in Sub-Saharan Africa amounted to 47 percent of the population , highlighting the disparities in digital access worldwide .
The statistic shows the average inflation rate in Turkey from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the average inflation rate in Turkey was at around 16.33 percent compared to the previous year . Turkey 's economy With a continuously growing gross domestic product /GDP and thus a rising share in the global GDP adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity , Turkey 's economy is one of the largest worldwide . By 2030 , Turkey is estimated to be one of the countries with the highest gross domestic product worldwide . Import of goods figures and export figures are rising as well , however , the trade balance of Turkey has been in the negative range for several years now with a downwards trend which indicates a serious trade deficit – or in other words : an imbalance between export and import costs ; the value of goods Turkey imports is a lot higher than the value of exported goods . Main export partners of Turkey for textiles , automotive goods , iron and steel , among other goods , are mostly European countries , with Germany leading the ranking , followed by Iraq , Great Britain , Italy and France . The most important economic sector for Turkey is the services sector , especially the tourism sector , which has experienced a significant boost over the last decade . Thus , Turkey is now among the most popular destinations for visitors of all nations . A look at gross domestic product /GDP growth in Turkey shows that the country suffered a brief setback during the economic crisis of 2008 , but swiftly recovered and was back in the black by 2010 . Turkey 's employment figures hardly suffered at all , they too recovered quickly and are now back to pre-crisis levels .
This statistic shows the total lobbying spending in the United States from 1998 to 2019 . In 2019 , the total lobbying spending amounted to 3.47 billion U.S. dollars . Additional information on lobbying in the United States Since the turn of the millennium , the amount spent on lobbying in the United States has more than doubled . The intention of firms employing lobbyists , who in turn lobby government officials , is to gain a degree of influence on the legislative process in the hope of legislation more favorable to their business or cause being passed . Lobbying occurs at all levels from local government to presidential elections . The industries utilizing lobbying as a means to gain influence come from a range of industries with the biggest spenders including pharmaceuticals , insurance , business associations as well as oil and gas . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , a pro business association , was the largest lobbying spender in 2018 by a considerable margin . Lobbying by the National Rifle Association has gained both domestic and global attention . Many observers have pointed to the lobby power of the National Rifle Association when attempting to explain the perceived lack of change in regards to gun control laws . Examples such as the national rifle association , alongside increasing lobbying spending , have lead to increased attention on the lobbying industry and the potential consequences of the industry 's increasing influence . Movements such as the Occupy Movement and protests against free-trade deals with other countries have called for restrictions on lobbying and the asymmetrical power it allows large corporations .
The District of Columbia had the highest robbery rate in the United States in 2017 , with 343.8 robberies per 100,000 inhabitants . The lowest robbery rate in the country was found in Vermont , with 11.2 robbers per 100,000 inhabitants . Crime in the District of Columbia The violent crime rate in the District of Columbia was also the highest in the country in 2018 , and there are a few reasons for this : Firstly , the population of the District of Columbia is quite low ( causing a higher rate of crime ) , and secondly , issues such as the crack epidemic of the 1990s exacerbated the prevalence of crime in the District . As rising rents and gentrification force more people out of the District , crime is moving into neighboring Maryland and Virginia suburbs , as poorer residents seek more affordable living conditions . Crime in the United States Overall , violent crime in the United States and the District of Columbia today is far below the violent crime rate of the 1990s . While some may feel that crime is on the rise , due in part to media sensationalism , in fact the opposite is true , and the United States are becoming safer over time .
The statistic shows the average inflation rate in Canada from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket . This product basket contains products and services , on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year . They include expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , power , telecommunications , recreational activities and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . In 2018 , the average inflation rate in Canada was approximately 2.24 percent compared to the previous year . For comparison , inflation in India amounted to 5.22 percent that same year . Inflation in Canada In general , the inflation rate in Canada follows a global trend of decreasing inflation rates since 2011 , with the lowest slump expected to occur during 2015 , but forecasts show an increase over the following few years . Additionally , Canada 's inflation rate is in quite good shape compared to the rest of the world . While oil and gas prices have dropped in Canada much like they have around the world , food and housing prices in Canada have been increasing . This has helped to offset some of the impact of dropping oil and gas prices and the effect this has had on Canada´s inflation rate . The annual consumer price index of food and non-alcoholic beverages in Canada has been steadily increasing over the last decade . The same is true for housing and other price indexes for the country . In general there is some confidence that the inflation rate will not stay this low for long , it is expected to return to a comfortable 2 percent by 2017 if estimates are correct .

Baked goods such as cookies and brownies are the type of cannabis edible most consumers are interested in trying.Cannabis regulation in Canada Regulation of the drug is not a straight forward topic , there has been issues keeping up with demand and not everyone agrees with the legalization of non-medical marijuana . As of October 2018 , over half of Canadians approved of the legalization . There is also an ongoing debate on how cannabis should be regulated , if it should be treated more like alcohol or tobacco .
The statistic shows the U.S. total arms exports in 2018 expressed in TIV , by country . The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer . The TIV is expressed here in million constant U.S. dollars as of 1990 . In 2018 , the U.S. arms exports to Saudi Arabia totaled to about 3,353 million constant ( 1990 ) U.S. dollars . The depicted value is only an indicator and does not correspond to the actual financial value of the transfers .

Manitoba , one of the three prairie provinces in Canada , was home to the highest cigarette prices in March 2018 . Consumers were paying 139.83 Canadian dollars for 200 cigarettes , almost 30 dollars more than the national average retail price of 112.06 dollars for 200 cigarettes in the same month . Consumers could purchase 200 cigarettes for just 96.36 Canadian dollars in Canada 's largest province of Quebec . Why do prices vary regionally ? Smoking products are tightly regulated across Canada , with regulations and legal smoking ages varying between provinces . Tobacco taxes can be used to dissuade consumers from purchasing cigarettes , in order to reduce rates of smoking and related diseases .

GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth . In 2018 , Greece 's real GDP increased by about 1.93 percent compared to the previous year . Greece 's national finances Greece is viewed as a high-income economy and experienced high economic and social growth and development between the 1950s and the 1970s , which was the highest rate in the world only behind Japan . However , due to the Great Recession in 2009 as well as the Greek government-debt crisis , Greek experienced severe hits to its already somewhat struggling economy . From the mid to late 2000s , national debt escalated severely but has , since 2012 , remained relatively stable , primarily due to several debt restructuring deals as well as stimulus packages from countries within the EU . Different forms of financial aid were offered to Greece from countries within the European Union in order to help maintain the country from going completely dysfunctional to the point that Greece would no longer be able to pay back its debts . Greece 's economy primarily strives in the service sector and benefits exceptionally from its tourist industry . However , due to a failing tourist industry as well as struggles with properly managing imports and exports , struggles within the country are further increasing . More competent leadership , cutting costs as well as new structural reforms are necessary in order to slowly bring Greece back to an economically stable country .

See the figures for the population of South Korea for comparison . Economy of South Korea South Korea is one of the world 's richest countries as well as a member of the G20 , an organization made up of the 20 strongest economies in the world . Due to excessive growth from the 1960s to the 1990s , South Korea established itself as a developed country in the world with a strong economy and high wages . Continued economic growth is attributed to a robust export-oriented economy , which was deemed necessary for the country particularly due to a scarcity in natural resources as well as overpopulation in comparison to available living space . During the global financial crisis , South Korea surprised many economists by maintaining a stable economy and even experiencing economic growth , most notably during the peak of the crisis . Through stimulus packages as well as a high level of consumption , South Korea 's strong export-oriented economy was not affected as negatively as many other developed countries . South Korea 's economy primarily revolves around the production and export of technological goods . Some primary exports of the country include electronics , ships and automobiles . South Korea also has some of the largest shipbuilding companies worldwide , which are highly profitable but also have accumulated a rather large sum of debt over the course of several years .

In 2018 , the rate of GDP growth in the United Kingdom was at around 1.4 percent compared to the previous year.The economy of the United Kingdom GDP is used an indicator as to the shape of a national economy . It is one of the most regularly called upon measurements regarding the economic fitness of a country . GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced in a country within a given period of time , usually a year . Inflation adjusted real GDP figures serve as an even more telling indication of a country 's economic state in that they act as a more reliable and clear tool as to a nation 's economic health . The gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate in the United Kingdom has started to level in recent years after taking a huge body blow in the financial collapse of 2008 . The UK managed to rise from the state of dark desperation it was in between 2009 and 2010 , from -3.97 to 1.8 percent . The country suffered acutely from the collapse of the banking industry , raising a number of questions within the UK with regards to the country 's heavy reliance on revenues coming from London 's financial sector , arguably the most important in the world and one of the globe 's financial command centers . Since the collapse of the post-war consensus and the rise of Thatcherism , the United Kingdom has been swept along in a wave of individualism - collective ideals have been abandoned and the mass privatisation of the heavy industries was unveiled - opening them up to market competition and shifting the economic focus to that of service . The Big Bang policy , one of the cornerstones of the Thatcher government programs of reform , involved mass and sudden deregulation of financial markets . This led to huge changes in the way the financial markets in London work , and saw the many old firms being absorbed by big banks . This , one could argue , strengthened the UK financial sector greatly and while frivolous and dangerous practices brought the sector into great disrepute , the city of London alone brings in around one fifth of the countries national income making it a very prominent contributor to wealth in the UK .

A decrease in immigrants and a potential increase in emigrations could , in return , be a result of the country 's slumping economy . Many aspects of Italy 's economy have suffered as a result of the 2008 financial crisis : Italy 's unemployment rate has increased severely , most notably between 2011 and 2012 and this trend is expected to continue over the next several years . Additionally , the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) has since decreased and has struggled to maintain stability . This is most evident in Italy 's real GDP growth rate . Not only is the growth rate minimal , but Italy has also experienced several years of negative growth , especially in 2009 . However , despite a struggling economy , the standard of living in Italy has remained affluent . In 2012 , Italy was ranked as one of the 30 countries with the highest Human Development Index rating . The Human Development Index , also known as the HDI , is based on values of life expectancy at birth , literacy rate , education levels and gross national income per capita . Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in the world as of 2011 , ranking 6th out of the top 20 countries .
Video gaming is no longer a hobby exclusively enjoyed by the young . As generations have grown up with video games a normal part of life , the age of the average gamer also increases . While 40 percent of video game players still come from the 18 to 35 age demographic , some 21 percent are 50 years and older . Time spent gaming In 2018 , Americans aged between 15 to 19 years spent 49 minutes on gaming or leisurely computer use during an average weekday , and more than 90 minutes doing so during weekends or holidays . The age demographic which devoted the least amount of time to gaming was the 45 to 54 years category . Members of this age demographic spent an average of just 10 minutes playing on the computer during the week and only 22 minutes during weekends and holidays . In a further survey , some 11.6 percent of respondents in the U.S. admitted to playing video games for more than 20 hours a week , while another 11.4 percent claimed to spend between 12 and 20 hours a week gaming . Gender split Gaming has traditionally been seen as a more male hobby , and this is reflected in the fact that , on average , men spent more time both during the week and on weekends playing games on the computer . However , the rise of female gamers has been rapid in recent years , with a 2019 figure estimating that 46 percent of all computer and video gamers in the United States are female . This is a significant increase from the 38 percent female gaming population in 2006 . Playing games at a professional level can also be a lucrative career for those at the very top of their game . The leading eSports players worldwide have earnings going well into the millions .
Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the United States , accounting for 23 percent of all deaths . Other leading causes of death include cancer , accidents , chronic lower respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases . The leading causes of death worldwide are like those in the U.S . However , lung cancer , road injury , diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are all major causes of death worldwide , but are not among the leading causes in the U.S . Instead , accidents , influenza and pneumonia , intentional self-harm and kidney diseases have a larger impact in the U.S . Racial differences In the United States , there exist slight differences in leading causes of death depending on race and ethnicity . For example , assault , or homicide , accounts for around 3 percent of all deaths among the black population but is not even among the leading causes of death for other races and ethnicities . However , heart disease and cancer are still the leading causes of death for all races and ethnicities . Gender differences Similarly , there are also differences in the leading causes of death in the U.S. depending on gender . For example , among males , intentional self-harm accounts for around 2.5 percent of all deaths but is not among the leading causes of death among females . On the other hand , septicemia and influenza and pneumonia account for more deaths among women than men .

As mobile apps become more popular and mobile internet more widely available , revenues generated from applications are reaching unprecedented records . There are a number of different ways in which to generate revenues from apps , including simply charging users a small amount of money per download , but this is not the most popular monetization models among worldwide mobile developers , which claim to use it in some 20 percent of the cases . In fact , statistics show that the number of apps in Google 's Play Store that charge for download has decreased 2015 compared to previous years . A variant of this model is the upgrade , where a free application will offer users the possibility to upgrade to a more enhanced or ad-free version of their product in exchange of a fee . The most widely used revenue stream is advertising , but , according to developers , also the most hated . In-app advertising revenues are set to reach 117.2 million U.S. dollars in 2020 , up from 40.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2015 .

This statistic shows the development of the gross domestic product of the United States of America from 1990 to 2019 . Gross domestic product ( GDP ) refers to the market value of all goods and services produced within a country . The U.S. GDP increased to about 21.4 trillion U.S. dollars in 2019 . The annual growth rate of the Real GDP can be found here . Currently , the United States is ranked first in the world GDP ranking . See , for example , the Russian GDP for comparison . U.S . Finances The gross domestic product ( GDP ) is one of the most important indicators used to analyze the health of an economy . GDP is defined by the BEA as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States , regardless of nationality . It is the primary measure of U.S. production . The OECD defines GDP as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident , institutional units engaged in production ( plus any taxes , and minus any subsidies , on products not included in the value of their outputs ) . Although the United States had the highest Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in the world in 2019 , the national debts of the United States are rising steadily . The national debt of the United States amounted to 18.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2014 and grew up to 21.5 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018 . A ranking of individual state debt in the United States shows that California is the state with the highest amount of debt in the United States , while New York was on rank 2 , New York 's debt amounted to 387.47 billion U.S. dollars . Vermont , North Dakota and South Dakota are the states with the lowest amount of debt . The U.S. government receives a part of its budget from taxpayers . According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the American government 's tax revenue was about 1.03 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018 . Since 2002 , the total amounts of the receipts are lower than the amount of the outlays of the United States and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget forecast that the gap between the receipts and outlays of the United States will only continue to widen . The result of this development is that the U.S. wo n't be able to reduce the national debt within the coming decade .

The statistic shows the gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in Brazil from 1984 to 2016 , with projections up until 2024 . GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year . It is considered to be a very important indicator of the economic strength of a country and a positive change is an indicator of economic growth . In 2018 , the estimated GDP per capita in Brazil amounted to around 8,958.58 U.S. dollars . For further information see GDP of Brazil . Economical future of Brazil GDP per capita is worked out by taking the country 's total gross domestic product and dividing it by the total population , which essentially helps determine growth of an economy as well as changes in productivity for every person living in the country . As a member of economic organizations such as the G20 as well as the BRIC countries , Brazil has certainly made its mark as one of the strongest economies in the world . Despite experiencing economic fluctuations often , the general direction of the Brazilian economy is mainly positive . With recent improvements within the government , bank and education systems , Brazil has become a slightly more significant option for international investments . Additionally , a profusion of natural resources , a strong agricultural and industrial sector , and a growing service sector has made investors more intrigued in the future of the country . Additionally , at the end of 2014 , consumer confidence saw a slight , however noticeable improvement , implying that individual financial situations and hope for the future of the country are very present within the country . Shortly after , consumer confidence plummeted , showing little faith in Brazil 's economic future . However , the economic benchmarks point in a different direction .
This statistic shows the gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in Russia from 1994 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . In 2018 , the GDP per capita in Russia was around 11,289.44 U.S. dollars . See the Russian GDP for comparison . Russia 's wealth Russia generates most of its wealth through its energy sector , given that a large percentage of its industrial and agricultural sectors have been privatized in the 1990s . The majority of Russia 's exports consisted of natural resources , such as oil , gas and metals . Russia 's primary export partners are located within Europe , with the exception of China , and are often the recipients of a large amount of Russia 's natural gas exports . The country 's second most important and influential sector is the military sector , due to having built up a complex arms industry and having the proficiency to produce high tech weapons . Russia ranks as one of the highest spenders for military production and is one of the more intimidating military powers in the world . Due to the privatization of Russia 's industrial and agricultural sectors , a rather large part of the population was able to capitalize on the market . Russia is home to one of the highest numbers of billionaires in the world , trailing only countries such as the United States and China .
The statistic shows GDP in India from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , GDP in India was at around 2.72 trillion US dollars . See figures on India 's economic growth here , and the Russian GDP for comparison . Economic liberalization on the Indian subcontinent Of all the factors and empirical data that give an insight into the shape of a national economy , there are n't as many indicators more telling than GDP . GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a year . Real GDP figures serve as an even more reliable tool in estimating in which direction a country 's economy may be heading , as they are adjusted for inflation and reflect real price developments . The decision of the newly independent Indian government to adopt a mixed economy , adopting both elements of both capitalist and socialist systems , resulted in huge inefficiencies borne out of the culture of interventionism that was a direct result of the lacklustre implementation of policy and failings within the system itself . The desire to move towards a Soviet style mass planning system failed to gain much momentum in the Indian case due to a number of hindrances , an unskilled workforce being one of many . When the government of the early 90 's saw the creation of small scale industry in large numbers due to the removal of price controls , the economy started to bounce back , but with the collapse of the Soviet Union - India 's main trading partner - the hampering effects of socialist policy on the economy were exposed and it underwent a large scale liberalization . By the turn of the 21st century , India was rapidly progressing towards a free-market economy . India 's development has continued and it now belongs to the BRIC group of fast developing economic powers .

By 2030 , the number of military retirees in the United States is expected to reach 2.21 million ; an increase from an estimated 2.18 million retirees in 2020 . Military retirement pay Military retirement pay was created to acknowledge those who served their country through a military career . Those who served in active duty , reserves , or guard for at least 20 years are entitled to military retirement pay . There are different factors that influence how much is paid out to different veterans , which includes length of service , disability percentage , the year the person entered the military , and type of retirement . The total payment for military retirees is expected to continue to increase , as well as their average benefits . However , the total outlays for the military retirement trust fund is expected to fluctuate over the next couple years . U.S veterans The United States has one of the largest militaries in the world based on active personnel and has the largest defense budget in the world . However , many veterans in the U.S. struggle to find a job and find affordable housing when they return from deployment due to factors such as post-traumatic stress disorder and physical disabilities . The Department of Veteran Affairs seeks to help those coming back from training or combat assimilate back into everyday life .
More than half of the world 's population identify as feminists - in India alone , over 80 percent of respondents very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists . Surprisingly , this number is much lower in developed countries like the United States or Germany ( with not even 40 percent of respondents agreeing ) , which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully – has . But are some really more equal than others ? Despite its deceptive title , feminism is not about establishing superiority of women – its core concept is equality for all , no matter their sex , gender , or orientation . Achieving this equality means championing women with more force and verve than has been done before , since today 's societies are deeply patriarchal – i.e . they favor men over women . Critics often misinterpret this support of women as an attempt to suppress and attack men – when in fact , feminism and equality for all benefits them as well . The country of the poets and thinkers seems stuck In Germany , feminism is on the rise , but traditional gender roles and insufficient information still hinder progress . Only a third of German women , and even fewer German men , define themselves as feminist , while at the same time , over 70 percent of women and almost 60 percent of men would agree that gender equality is important to them . Still , they are not convinced that discrimination against women is ending anytime soon . Most of all , they say , reallocating responsibility and adjusting payrolls would help to achieve a feminist society .
The statistic shows the unemployment rate in Japan from 1999 to 2019 . In 2019 , the unemployment rate in Japan was at about 2.41 percent . Employment and the economy in Japan Japan is one of the leading countries when it comes to economic key factors ; its unemployment rate , for example , is lower than that of other major industrial and emerging countries . The Japanese work ethic is well-known worldwide , it is synonymous with a strong devotion to the company and to the task at hand ; competition among co-workers and loyalty to the company are common and encouraged , working hours and over-time work are said to be excessive . The Japanese language even has its own term for sudden death from being overworked – `` Karoshi '' . After the devastating effects of World War II , Japan managed to recover economically and even earn a prominent role among other leading economic powers – a fact which is probably partly due to this attitude towards work and employment . Today , Japan is among the leading import countries worldwide , as well as the leading export countries worldwide . Additionally , Japan is one of the 20 countries with the largest proportion of the global domestic product , and also among the 20 countries with the largest gross domestic product per capita , even though it is also ranked tenth among the leading countries with the largest population .
It is expected that by 2023 , around 62.5 million Filipinos will become users of a social network . Considering the forecasted population of around 118 million , it reflects the high popularity of social media in the Philippines . Current state of social media in the Philippines The Philippines have been called the social media capital of the world , because most of the social media users have an extraordinarily high usage time of about four hours per day . Additionally , they are known as early technology adopters , as well as being highly internet-savvy . Yet the infrastructure can not keep up with the population 's needs . The archipelago consists of around seven thousand islands , making it difficult for the government to provide basic connectivity . As of 2017 , around 64 million out of 105 million inhabitants had internet access . While 81 percent of the 18- to 24-year-olds were already online , only twelve percent of those aged 55 years and older were able to access the internet . How are the Philippines able to improve their accessibility ? Since it is widely recognized that internet access has an impact on economic growth , local authorities must focus on further expanding the network . There are few promising technologies to do so : fiber cables could be installed and even reduce the cost of telecommunication companies in the end . The upcoming 5G network could help connect remote areas with a trustworthy connection , and if that is too far into the future , satellites could be a viable choice for now ; they are able to reach every point on the earth , making them key for achieving nationwide connectivity .

In 2018 , the workforce in China had amounted to around 775.9 million people.Workforce in China – additional information In 2017 , China 's total population had reached 1.39 billion . The labor force of China , which refers to the population aged 16 and over and capable of working , stood at 806 million in 2018 , marking a slight decrease of one million people from 2017 . Out of the economically active population , approximately 776 million had been employed in 2018 . As of 2018 , there were about 43.4 billion people employed in urban areas , while 342 million people had been working in rural areas . Although the workforce in China had been steadily increasing , the labor force participation rate in China , meaning the share of the Chinese working-age population that participated in the labor force had slightly decreased , dropping from 72.3 percent in 2007 to 68.9 percent in 2017 . Between 2008 to 2018 , the share of the workforce employed in the primary sector had declined significantly in China from 39.6 percent in 2008 to 26.1 percent in 2018 , whereas the percentage of people employed in the secondary and tertiary sectors increased . As of 2018 , about 27.6 percent of Chinese workers had been employed in secondary and 46.3 percent in tertiary industries.Partly influenced by the implementation of the one-child policy , the fertility rate in China has receded , resulting in a demographic shift of the age pyramid and , in turn , of the overall workforce .
This statistic shows the average inflation rate in South Korea from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the average inflation rate in South Korea amounted to about 1.48 percent compared to the previous year . For further info , see the South Korean GDP . South Korea 's low inflation High rates of inflation are undesireable , just like low rates , and South Korea is currently struggling with the latter . South Korea is actually an affluent country and currently ranks 11th on the list of the 20 countries with the largest GDP , but its inflation rate is subject to concern , as it is currently at levels below 2 percent . However , there is still hope that inflation will return to stable rates between 3 and 4.5 percent in the next few years , and there are also signs that consumer confidence is rising after two years of weak economic growth and sluggish domestic consumption and investment . The unemployment rate remains low with levels staying in the range of 3 percent - close to full employment – yet there are still obstacles including an aging population and a heavy reliance on exports . At present , South Korea is attempting to balance its reliance on exports by expanding the service industry , especially as the export market slows .
This statistic shows the unemployment rate of Iran from 1999 to 2019 . In 2019 , Iran 's unemployment rate was estimated to amount to 11.99 percent of the total labor force . Employment and economy in Iran Iran 's unemployment rate has been above 10 percent for the last 10 years , and this rate is estimated to have peaked in 2014 , when estimates reached 14 percent . Also , many of those who are considered employed in Iran are also considered underemployed . Unemployment in Iran is especially high among young people and women ; over 70 percent of the population 's close to 80 million inhabitants are of working age , increasing the overall demand of these inhabitants for work . Iran 's economy has also been in a recession , which has exacerbated the difficulties to meet the employment demands of its inhabitants . Although the economy is expected to recover slightly in 2014 , Iran 's GDP is expected to decrease and the real GDP growth rate is either negative or quite low . In times of a struggling economy , it is typically more difficult to create jobs and introduce people to the labor force . Because Iran 's economic activity still depends to a large extent on oil revenues , this also reduces the stability of the economy and employment . With a decreasing per capita GDP and a high inflation rate people are also more vulnerable to changes in income and employment , making the unemployment a pressing issue that the country will have to manage .
The statistic shows Mexico 's GDP from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , Mexico 's GDP amounted to approximately 1.22 trillion US dollars.Economy of Mexico GDP is an indicator primarily used to gauge the state and health of a national economy . GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within national borders in a given period of time , usually a year . GDP gives us an insight into a country 's economic development over a period of time , how its development fits in with international shifts and how it is affected by the factors that affect market economies . The demand among some segments of the Chinese workforce for fairer payment , coupled with higher transportations costs , have been key factors in increasing the competitiveness of Mexican manufacturing , with some suggestions being made that it is already cheaper than China for the many industries that serve the lucrative United States market . The Mexican economy is , however , far from trouble-free . And although the gross domestic product in Mexico has been increasing , it is showing that it is struggling to match up to the fast pace of growth and prosperity being seen in some of the BRIC countries , as well as the usual suspects of economic success , the United States , Canada and others . Inequality in Mexico remains a huge problem . The education system in the federation 's thirty-one states is in dire need of reform , and in some of the states , especially in those closest to the US border , brutal criminal drug lords'rule . It is important for Mexicans that they embrace the opportunity that they find themselves presented with at present and harness the energy of their large population , the newly arrived foreigners and their educated youth , in order to provide the country with the future prosperity that it most desperately needs .

The statistic shows global gross domestic product ( GDP ) from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , global GDP amounted to about 84.93 trillion U.S. dollars . Gross domestic product Gross domestic product , also known as GDP , is the accumulated value of all finished goods and services produced in a country , often measured annually . GDP is significant in determining the economic health , growth and productivity in the country , and is a stat often used when comparing several countries at a time , most likely in order to determine which country has seen the most progress . Global GDP has experienced a growth every year over the past decade with the exception of 2009 . However , a strong growth rate does not necessarily lead to all positive outcomes and often has a negative affect on inflation rates . A severe growth in GDP leads to less unemployment , however lower unemployment often leads to higher inflation rates due to demand increasing at a much higher rate than supply and as a result prices rise accordingly . Despite a relatively high global GDP growth , unemployment only marginally changed over the course of 5 years and is forecasted to remain stagnant going into 2017 . Unemployment , however , is often difficult to predict , primarily now since most economies are still recovering from the 2008 global financial crisis .
Japan 's suicide numbers peaked in 2009 , when the country experienced its worst recession since World War II . That year , the suicide rate surged to 25.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and almost 33 thousand victims in total . Despite noticeably decreasing suicide numbers in recent years , Japan still had one of the highest suicide rates among high-income OECD nations . In 2018 , the country reported 16.5 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants . What are the reasons behind Japan 's high suicide rates ? Historically , Japan 's high suicide rates were closely linked to the economic situation of individuals . While the majority of suicides in Japan stemmed from health reasons , existential worries and problems directly related to work accounted for over 5,000 self-inflicted deaths in 2018 . The most profound issue faced by employees in Japan leading to self-harm was exhaustion . An increasing pressure of retaining jobs by putting in more hours of overtime , while taking fewer holidays and sick days were seen as the main motivators behind the rising suicide numbers among office workers and employees . Occupational sudden mortality , known as karoshi ( `` death by overwork '' ) is a well-known phenomenon in Japanese society . Besides physical pressure , mental stress from the workplace can cause karoshi . Suicide due to occupational stress or overwork is called karojisatsu ( `` overwork suicide '' ) in Japan . Which demographic groups are affected ? While middle-aged men were frequently portrayed as the highest-risk group for suicide in Japan , suicides among elderly and school children were recurrently picked up by media . Financial anxiety , bullying , isolation and the lack of a proficient mental healthcare system were only some of the factors for contributing to the country 's high suicide rates amongst all age groups .
How much are acrylic nails in the U.S. ? Nail salons in the U.S. charged an average price of 46.01 U.S. dollars for a full set of acrylics in 2019 . Nail salons in the U.S . The nail salon industry in the United States is a large and thriving industry , which is active across all 50 states . However , the accessibility and types of clients have changed drastically since the early 20th century . In the early 1900s , nail salons were accessible to only wealthy women . Over the next two decades , it became possible to buy nail polish in stores . Having a manicured hand was a sign of wealth and social status during that time period . In today 's society , manicures and pedicures are available to everyone . As a result of this , there has been an increased amount of spending on nail salon services from 1998 . However , the number of nail salons in the United States has decreased since 2006 . On the other hand , the number of nail technicians has increased . Manicurists and pedicurists make about one third of what theatrical and performance makeup artists make , who are the highest paid employees in personal appearance services in the United States . Nail services Acrylics are one of the many services offered at nail salons . Acrylic nails are a mix of powder and liquid product , which are shaped into a soft ball and then formed into a nail shape . The acrylic is applied to the nail then hardened to become stronger , then painted with nail polish . The average price for an acrylic fill has steadily increased from 2006 to 2019 . Acrylic nail upkeep requires coming to the nail salon about every two weeks .
As of 2005 , people in the United States stated that they have had an average of 10.7 sexual partners , which is slightly above the global average of nine sexual partners . Turkey in the lead ? Surveys on sensitive or very personal topics , like sexuality , are often to be taken with a grain of salt , but in this case , Turkey did not only lead the ranking in 2005 , it also topped the one conducted in 2010 on the mean number of sexual partners . So is it likely that the Turkish people are sexually more prolific than everybody else ? Another survey by another source suggests otherwise : It does not include Turkey when it comes to the countries with the most sexually active inhabitants but lists the Greek as the most active ones . In general , people tend to embellish their own activities , but also those of others – the disparity between the perceived and the actual number of times people have sex is staggering and similar everywhere around the world . India the most monogamous ? Of those countries surveyed , Indian respondents report the lowest average number of sexual partners , only slightly surpassed by China . Both China and India struggle with a significant difference between the number of men and the number of women , and both countries largely adhere to conservative standards of sexuality that prohibit sex before marriage .

France has a relatively high gross domestic product ( GDP ) , being one of the top 10 countries with the largest GDP in the world in 2014 . Despite this , the country is still ranked in the top 20 in regards to its public debt compared to its GDP in the same year . A high debt-to-GDP ratio demonstrates a country 's ability to produce and sell goods and services in order to be able to pay back its debts , however producing and selling these goods should not result in more debts . France 's national debt slightly increased year-over-year up until 2014 , most notably between 2008 and 2009 . Additionally , France reported a large trade deficit in 2012 , a value almost 5 times larger compared to the previous year , indicating that the country is importing much more than it is exporting . This often leads to higher debts due to a need to borrow more money to produce goods .

This statistic shows the national debt of Ireland from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the national debt of Ireland was around 226.92 billion U.S. dollars . For comparison , the Greek debt amounted to approximately 303 billion euros that same year . In a ranking of debt to GDP per country , Ireland is thus currently ranked tenth , while Greece is ranked second . Ireland and the economic crisis Ireland has been severely affected by the economic crisis owing mainly to the bursting of its real estate bubble in 2007 . The crisis led to a dramatic decline in real estate prices and was a major factor in the financial and banking crisis , causing Ireland to enter recession in 2008 – which means that the economy underwent a period of decline , unemployment figures soared , numerous bankruptcies resulted and many businesses were forced into closure , and inflation and GDP declined . Ireland 's budget balance seems to be in remission from a severe state deficit in 2010 . It continues to show negative figures to this day . Ireland was not the only country to be hit severely by the economic crisis , other countries are also suffering : Portugal , for example , reported an ever higher national debt than Ireland in 2012 and an even higher state deficit . Spain is another casualty ; it has been reporting extraordinarily high unemployment figures since 2008 , the rate of unemployment is still on the rise . The country suffering most due to the economic crisis , however , was and still is Greece , with a national debt almost one-and-a-half times as large as Ireland 's at times , and an unemployment rate to rival that of Spain , as well as a devastated economy . As for Ireland , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the European Union 's European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) agreed to support the country financially with a loan in 2010 . However , the country is still not out of recession and might struggle to secure economic recovery for another few years at least .

The developer 's revenue reached two billion U.S. dollars in 2018 , a marked increase from revenue of less than 60 million U.S. dollars in 2010 . King of the developers In its early years in the social gaming world , King relied on in-game advertising and micro-transactions to generate revenue . The latter enabled players to make in-game purchases to improve their virtual world or help them past a particularly tricky level . However , in a move to win over its legion of fans , the company decided to remove all in-game advertising in June 2013 and focused on micro-transactions to bring in the money . This strategy seemed to pay off as the monthly active users of King continued to increase and peaked at 550 million users at the beginning of 2015 . However , the MAU figure has been steadily falling in the ensuing years and the company was acquired in February 2016 by Activision Blizzard , famed for games such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch , in a deal worth almost six billion U.S. dollars . The publisher has since seen an upturn in its fortunes and registered record operating income of 750 million U.S. dollars in 2018 .

The colorful puzzle game became an overnight sensation and could be seen on smartphones across the world . While the game itself is free-to-play , users have the option of making in-game purchases to help them get past certain levels . This is where King 's micro-transaction revenue model truly paid off as player spending in Candy Crush mobile games worldwide reached over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . Despite the fast-paced nature of mobile gaming and the new releases that hit our screens every day , Candy Crush Saga still remains one of the most popular free-to-play games on the market .

The total unemployment rate in Mexico took a turn for the worse during the recession of 2008 and is still to bounce back to previous levels . Mexico 's main export and import partner is the United States which accounts for approximately half of the value of both . Thus , the trade balance of goods in Mexico , showing the value of exports minus the value of imports , is heavily dependant on the United States . For the past decade , Mexico 's trade balance has run at a deficit of more than 10 billion US dollars . The trade balance of services sector in Mexico has also been in the red with a deficit of more than 6 percent since the recession and higher than 9 percent since 2011 . Mexico is also one of the largest drug exporting countries worldwide . Specific trade figures are not available , however , Mexico is among the top countries for opium cultivation based on acreage , and thousands of illegal poppy fields , processed into opium , have been destroyed in Mexico year after year .

In spring 2019 , 35 percent of teenagers ranked the photo-sharing app as their most important social network . Teens and social media in the United States As evidenced by exasperated parents and teachers everywhere , social media is one of the most popular online activities among teenagers in the United States . Despite the near-constant social media usage , teens are usually reasonably aware of the time they spent online . During an April 2018 survey , 54 and 41 percent of responding teens stated that they spent too much time on their cellphone and on social media respectively . Due to constant interaction with other people online , teens come across a wide range of personalities . The most common personality types that teens come across social media are oversharers ( people who share too many personal details on social media ) and ranters ( people who rant and complain about things a lot ) . Social media and emotional well-being One of the key benefits of social media is that it can make teenagers feel less lonely and more confident and popular . However , with teens who have a low social-emotional well-being , social media can exacerbate pre-existing problems such as feeling left out or being excluded , as well as feeling bad about themselves when their posts did not get enough likes or comments . In the end , online socializing can make up for the lack of friends IRL ( in real life ) but it can also make things worse for teens who are already in emotional turmoil .
