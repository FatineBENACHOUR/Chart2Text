Shortage of medical staffs The Korean government officially declared a shortage of several templateXValue[158] templateYlabel[2] across the nation and recommended the training of an additional 150 templateYlabel[2] every templateXlabel[0] to make up the shortfall . Furthermore , templateYlabel[2] of traditional Korean medicine are counted among the templateYlabel[0] of templateYlabel[2] , meaning there are even fewer templateYlabel[2] of modern medical sciences than the official figures suggest .

Regional imbalances in the medical environment Some experts refute the government 's claims that templateTitle[8] faces a templateYlabel[2] shortage and point towards other factors . For example , templateTitle[8] has a higher population density than other countries , meaning that the average Korean templateYlabel[2] meets with more patients than an Austrian or Norwegian would , for example .

More than half of the world 's population templateTitle[0] as feminists - in templateXvalue[1] alone , over 80 percent of templateYlabel[2] very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists . Surprisingly , this number is much lower in developed countries like the templateXvalue[8] templateXvalue[8] or templateXvalue[24] ( with not even 40 percent of templateYlabel[2] agreeing ) , which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully – has . But templateYlabel[0] some really more equal than others ? Despite its deceptive title , feminism is not about establishing superiority of women – its core concept is equality for all , no matter their sex , gender , or orientation . Achieving this equality means championing women with more force and verve than has been done before , since today 's societies templateYlabel[0] deeply patriarchal – i.e . they favor men over women .

Current state of templateTitle[4] media in the templateTitle[0] The templateTitle[0] have been called the templateTitle[4] media capital of the world , because most of the templateTitle[4] media templateYlabel[2] have an extraordinarily high usage time of about templateXValue[76] hours per day . Additionally , they are known as early technology adopters , as well as being highly internet-savvy . Yet the infrastructure can not keep up with the population 's needs . The archipelago consists of around templateXValue[116] templateXValue[117] islands , making it difficult for the government to provide basic connectivity . As of templateXvalue[6] , around 64 templateYlabel[4] out of 105 templateYlabel[4] inhabitants had internet access . While 81 percent of the 18- to 24-year-olds were already online , only templateXValue[160] percent of those aged templateYvalue[4] years and older were able to access the internet . How are the templateTitle[0] able to improve their accessibility ? Since it is widely recognized that internet access has an impact on economic growth , local authorities must focus on further expanding the templateTitle[5] . There are few promising technologies to do templateTitle[4] templateTitle[1] fiber cables could be installed and even reduce the cost of telecommunication companies in the end . The upcoming 5G templateTitle[5] could help connect remote areas with a trustworthy connection , and if that is too far into the future , satellites could be a viable choice for now ; they are able to reach every point on the earth , making them key for achieving nationwide connectivity .

In templateXvalue[6] , the average templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[1] in templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] amounted to about templateYvalue[6] percent templateYlabel[2] to the templateYlabel[4] templateXlabel[0] . For further info , see the templateTitle[3] Korean GDP . templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] 's low templateYlabel[0] High rates of templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[2] undesireable , just like low rates , and templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] is currently struggling with the latter . templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] is actually an affluent country and currently ranks 11th on the list of the templateXvalue[0] countries with the largest GDP , but its templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[1] is subject to concern , as it is currently at levels below templateXvalue[0] percent . However , there is still hope that templateYlabel[0] will return to stable rates between templateXvalue[1] and 4.5 percent in the next few years , and there templateYlabel[2] also signs that consumer confidence is rising after templateXValue[156] years of weak economic growth and sluggish domestic consumption and investment . The unemployment templateYlabel[1] remains low with levels staying in the range of templateXvalue[1] percent - close to full employment – yet there templateYlabel[2] still obstacles including an aging population and a heavy reliance on exports . At present , templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] is attempting to balance its reliance on exports by expanding the service industry , especially as the export market slows .

The demand among some segments of the Chinese workforce for fairer payment , coupled with higher transportations costs , have been key factors in increasing the competitiveness of Mexican manufacturing , with some suggestions being made that it is already cheaper than China for the many industries that serve the lucrative United States market . The Mexican economy is , however , far from trouble-free . And although the templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[1] templateYlabel[2] in templateTitle[7] has been increasing , it is showing that it is struggling to match up to the fast pace of growth and prosperity being seen in some of the BRIC countries , as well as the usual suspects of economic success , the United States , Canada and others . Inequality in templateTitle[7] remains a huge problem . The education system in the federation 's templateXValue[255] states is in dire need of reform , and in some of the states , especially in those closest to the US border , brutal criminal drug lords'rule .

However , a strong growth rate does not necessarily lead to all positive outcomes and often has a negative affect on inflation rates . A severe growth in templateYlabel[0] leads to less unemployment , however lower unemployment often leads to higher inflation rates due to demand increasing at a much higher rate than supply and as a result prices rise accordingly . Despite a relatively high templateTitle[0] templateYlabel[0] growth , unemployment only marginally changed over the course of templateYvalue[0] years and is forecasted to remain stagnant going into templateXvalue[7] . Unemployment , however , is often difficult to predict , primarily now since most economies are still recovering from the 2008 templateTitle[0] financial crisis .
templateTitle[3] 's templateYlabel[2] numbers peaked in templateXvalue[9] , when the country experienced its worst recession since World War II . That templateXlabel[0] , the templateYlabel[2] templateTitle[1] surged to templateYvalue[9] deaths templateYlabel[3] templateYlabel[4] templateYlabel[5] and almost 33 templateXValue[36] victims in total . Despite noticeably decreasing templateYlabel[2] numbers in recent years , templateTitle[3] still had templateXValue[53] of the highest templateYlabel[2] rates among high-income OECD nations . In templateXvalue[0] , the country reported templateYvalue[0] templateYlabel[2] templateYlabel[3] templateYlabel[4] templateYlabel[5] . What are the reasons behind templateTitle[3] 's high templateYlabel[2] rates ? Historically , templateTitle[3] 's high templateYlabel[2] rates were closely linked to the economic situation of individuals . While the majority of templateYlabel[2] in templateTitle[3] stemmed from health reasons , existential worries and problems directly related to work accounted for over 5,000 self-inflicted deaths in templateXvalue[0] . The most profound issue faced by employees in templateTitle[3] leading to self-harm was exhaustion . An increasing pressure of retaining jobs by putting in more hours of overtime , while taking fewer holidays and sick days were seen as the main motivators behind the rising templateYlabel[2] numbers among office workers and employees . Occupational sudden mortality , known as karoshi ( `` death by overwork '' ) is a well-known phenomenon in Japanese society . Besides physical pressure , mental stress from the workplace can cause karoshi . templateYlabel[2] due to occupational stress or overwork is called karojisatsu ( `` overwork templateYlabel[2] '' ) in templateTitle[3] . Which demographic groups are affected ? While middle-aged men were frequently portrayed as the highest-risk group for templateYlabel[2] in templateTitle[3] , templateYlabel[2] among elderly and school children were recurrently picked up by media . Financial anxiety , bullying , isolation and the lack of a proficient mental healthcare system were only some of the factors for contributing to the country 's high templateYlabel[2] rates amongst all age groups .
How much are templateTitle[7] nails in the templateYlabel[3] ? templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] in the templateYlabel[3] charged an templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[1] of templateYvalue[0] templateYlabel[3] templateYlabel[4] templateTitle[2] a templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] of templateTitle[7] in templateXvalue[0] . templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] in the templateYlabel[3] . The templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] industry in the United States is a large and thriving industry , which is active across all templateYvalue[11] states . However , the accessibility and types of clients have changed drastically since the early 20th century . In the early 1900s , templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] were accessible to only wealthy women . Over the next templateXValue[94] decades , it became possible to buy templateTitle[9] polish in stores . Having a manicured hand was a sign of wealth and social status during that time period . In today 's society , manicures and pedicures are available to everyone . As a result of this , there has been an increased amount of spending on templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] services from 1998 . However , the number of templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] in the United States has decreased since templateXvalue[13] . On the other hand , the number of templateTitle[9] technicians has increased . Manicurists and pedicurists make about templateXValue[192] third of what theatrical and performance makeup artists make , who are the highest paid employees in personal appearance services in the United States . templateTitle[9] services templateTitle[7] are templateXValue[222] of the many services offered at templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] . templateTitle[7] nails are a mix of powder and liquid product , which are shaped into a soft ball and then formed into a templateTitle[9] shape . The templateTitle[7] is applied to the templateTitle[9] then hardened to become stronger , then painted with templateTitle[9] polish . The templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[1] templateTitle[2] an templateTitle[7] fill has steadily increased from templateXvalue[13] to templateXvalue[0] . templateTitle[7] templateTitle[9] upkeep requires coming to the templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] about every templateXValue[303] weeks .
As of 2005 , people in the templateXvalue[13] templateXvalue[13] stated that they have had an templateYlabel[0] of templateYvalue[12] templateTitle[2] templateYlabel[3] , which is slightly above the templateXvalue[0] templateYlabel[0] of templateYValue[29] templateTitle[2] templateYlabel[3] . templateXvalue[1] in the lead ? Surveys on sensitive or very personal topics , like sexuality , are often to be taken with a grain of salt , but in this case , templateXvalue[1] did not only lead the ranking in 2005 , it also topped the templateYValue[79] conducted in 2010 on the mean templateYlabel[1] of templateTitle[2] templateYlabel[3] . templateXvalue[5] is it likely that the Turkish people are sexually more prolific than everybody else ? Another survey templateTitle[5] another source suggests otherwise : It does not include templateXvalue[1] when it comes to the countries with the most sexually active inhabitants but lists the Greek as the most active templateXvalue[37] . In general , people tend to embellish their own activities , but also those of others – the disparity between the perceived and the actual templateYlabel[1] of times people have templateTitle[2] is staggering and similar everywhere around the templateTitle[4] . templateXvalue[41] the most monogamous ? Of those countries surveyed , Indian respondents report the lowest templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[1] of templateTitle[2] templateYlabel[3] , only slightly surpassed templateTitle[5] templateXvalue[40] . Both templateXvalue[40] and templateXvalue[41] struggle with a significant difference between the templateYlabel[1] of men and the templateYlabel[1] of women , and both countries largely adhere to conservative standards of sexuality that prohibit templateTitle[2] before marriage .

In templateXvalue[0] , the templateYlabel[0] templateYlabel[1] at templateTitle[3] games of the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] was 68,990 . templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] templateYlabel[0] templateTitle[3] templateYlabel[1] templateTitle[10] additional information The templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] ' templateYlabel[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYlabel[1] has remained relatively constant in recent years , with the templateYlabel[0] in the templateXvalue[0] templateTitle[2] standing at 68,990 . This figure puts the team almost above templateYlabel[0] compared to the entire NFL templateYlabel[0] , which was recorded as 66,151 in templateXvalue[0] . The Dallas Cowboys were the best supported team throughout the templateXvalue[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] as an templateYlabel[0] of over 90,000 fans watched each of their templateTitle[3] games .

The templateTitle[8] have enjoyed considerable success in recent years , making the playoffs in the templateXvalue[9] and templateXvalue[7] seasons . The franchise then went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII in templateXvalue[5] , beating the Denver Broncos 43 templateTitle[10] templateYvalue[0] . This marked the team 's first Super Bowl win in its history , having previously lost Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2005 . CenturyLink Field was opened as the templateTitle[8] Stadium in July 2002 but was renamed Qwest Field in June 2004 when the telecommunications carrier acquired the naming rights .

Despite this , the country is still ranked in the top templateXvalue[0] in regards to its public debt compared to its templateYlabel[0] in the same templateXlabel[0] . A high debt-to-GDP ratio demonstrates a country 's ability to produce and sell goods and services in order to be able to pay back its debts , however producing and selling these goods should not result in more debts . templateTitle[7] 's national debt slightly increased year-over-year up until templateXvalue[10] , most notably between templateXvalue[16] and templateXvalue[15] . Additionally , templateTitle[7] reported a large trade deficit in templateXvalue[12] , a value almost templateYvalue[6] times larger compared to the previous templateXlabel[0] , indicating that the country is importing much more than it is exporting . This often leads to higher debts due to a need to borrow more money to produce goods .
