Population of Spain While Spain’s fertility rate has been relatively steady over the past decade, its year-over-year population growth has been declining continuously at the same time. A very noticeable plunge was observed from 2008 to 2009, when population growth was almost halved. Reasons for this decline are manifold, it is speculated that is was caused by the economic crisis taking place simultaneously. The collapse of the job and real estate markets may have led the Spanish to postpone having (more) kids or to migrate to other countries in search of a more stable economy. This theory is supported by data on the average age of Spain’s inhabitants; a look at the median age of Spain’s population from 1950 up until today shows that the Spanish get older on average – perhaps due to the aforementioned factors. Speaking of Spain’s economy, economic key factors suggest that the country is still recovering from the crisis.

Only recently has Spain reported actual GDP growth since 2008, it remains to be seen if this is going to translate into a positive trend over the next few years.

The labor force is made up of the people who are old enough and physically fit enough to work. The unemployment rate is an important economic factor, but economists do not always agree on what exactly causes unemployment. They do agree, however, that unemployment typically rises during bad times for the economy, i.e. recessions. As for other important economic factors, Russia’s inflation rate has been decreasing for a few years now, while its real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product is still recovering from a steep decline in 2009. As most other economies, Russia’s economy focuses mostly on the Services and Industry sector, while the Agriculture sector plays little to no role when it comes to gross domestic product generation. Consequently, the vast majority of the labor force works in those two sectors. However, Russia is among the top wheat exporters worldwide, ranking third after the United States and Canada.

In 2007, CEO Jobs changed the name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc. while announcing the first-generation iPhone, shifting the company’s focus from computers to consumer electronics. iPhone’s great success contributes to Apple’s booming revenue and helped to make the company one of the world’s most valuable brands. In recent years, iPhone sales have consistently made up for about 60 percent of Apple’s total revenue. 
 This timeline depicts the Coca-Cola Company's net operating revenues worldwide from 2007 to 2019. In 2019, the Coca-Cola Company's net operating revenues worldwide amounted to around 37.27 billion U.S. dollars. The Coca-Cola Company is a producer, retailer and marketer of non-alcoholic beverages and is well-known for its soft drink Coca-Cola.

The company’s flagship product, Coca-Cola, was invented by John Stith Pemberton in Georgia during his attempts to find a substitute for his morphine addiction. Originally the recipe was a coca wine and Pemberton registered the drink as a nerve tonic in 1885. In 1889, the recipe was bought and the Coca-Cola Company was incorporated. Today, the company owns over 500 brands for a wide range of products, including Sprite and Columbia Pictures. The Coca-Cola label is one of the worlds most recognizable and is one of the most understood terms as well. It is one of the most valuable brands globally, garnering a brand value totaling 81.56 billion U.S. dollars as of 2014. One of its brands, Vitamin Water, led to some controversy and finally led to a lawsuit in 2009. The Center of Science in the Public Interest filed a case against the company claiming that the company had deceptively marketed their product as a healthy drink containing nutrients and did not inform consumers about the amount of sugar it contained. A settlement agreement was eventually paid by Coca-Cola and also forced the company to put the number of calories on the label and bold text stating, “see nutrition facts for more detail”. 
 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Indonesia from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Indonesia amounted to about 3.2 percent compared to the previous year. The global financial crisis and economic consequences The global economy underwent a drastic slump due to the global financial crisis in 2008, which caused a continued increase in the general level of prices of goods and services; the highest recorded global inflation of the past decade took place in 2008, when the global inflation rate increased by more than 6.4 percent in comparison with the previous year. As for Indonesia, the country's inflation rate amounted to around 9.8 percent in comparison to the previous year. The financial crisis also impacted the global unemployment rate. In 2009, the global unemployment rate jumped to around 6.2 percent, and it is not expected to recover to pre-crisis levels anytime soon. The financial crisis impact on the Indonesian economy was slightly more severe: In 2008, the unemployment rate in Indonesia was around 8.4 percent, much higher than the global unemployment rate for the same year. It has, however, now decreased significantly, even though it is still not below the global level, the country itself has reached lower levels than before the crisis. After the financial crisis, the Indonesian government implemented several economic reforms and increased exports in order to strengthen the economy. In 2011, Indonesia exported goods with a value of more than 200 billion U.S. dollars. The main export partners of Indonesia are Japan, China and Singapore. As a result of increased exports, the Indonesian economy was able to grow, making Indonesia one of the twenty nations in the world with the largest gross domestic product in 2015.

 This statistic shows the gross sales of Mattel's Barbie brand worldwide from 2012 to 2019. In 2019, Mattel's Barbie brand generated gross sales amounting to about 1.16 billion U.S. dollars, up from about 1.09 billion U.S. dollars the year before. Additional information on Mattel’s Barbie Since the launch of Mattel’s Barbie fashion doll in 1959, Barbie has become a cultural icon in America and around the world. The commercial success of Barbie has allowed Mattel to become the one of the most valuable toy brand worldwide as of 2019. Although a truly worldwide phenomena, a considerable proportion of Mattel’s sales come from America and Canada. A look at the gross sales of Mattel by region shows that over half of Mattel’s revenues are generated in the North American region. Just as in other business markets, the success of Barbie does not ensure for commercial success to be guaranteed in the future. Competition over retail doll sales in America is fierce. Despite some fluctuation in recent years, the total sales for toy dolls in the U.S. lies consistently in the range of two to three billion U.S. dollars. Given the fluctuation in sales of Barbie dolls it is clear Mattel must maintain interest in Barbie and their other products if they are to retain their current market share. 
 The statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The gross domestic product of the United States in 2018 amounted to around 20.58 trillion U.S. dollars. For comparison, the GDP of China had amounted to 10.43 trillion U.S. dollars, marking the second-largest economy in the world. See U.S. GDP per capita for more information. The United States and the economy The United States’ economy is by far the largest in the world; a status which can be determined by several key factors, one being gross domestic product: A look at the GDP of the main industrialized and emerging countries shows a significant difference between US GDP and the GDP of China, the runner-up in the ranking, as well as the followers Japan, Germany and France. Interestingly, it is assumed that China will have surpassed the States in terms of GDP by 2030, but for now, the United States is among the leading countries in almost all other relevant rankings and statistics, trade and employment for example. See the U.S. GDP growth rate here. Just like in other countries, the American economy suffered a severe setback when the economic crisis occurred in 2008. The American economy entered a recession caused by the collapsing real estate market and increasing unemployment. Despite this, the standard of living is considered quite high; life expectancy in the United States has been continually increasing slightly over the past decade, the unemployment rate in the United States has been steadily recovering and decreasing since the crisis, and the Big Mac Index, which represents the global prices for a Big Mac, a popular indicator for the purchasing power of an economy, shows that the United States’ purchasing power in particular is only slightly lower than that of the euro area.

 The statistic shows the growth rate of the real gross domestic product (GDP) in Japan from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, Japan's GDP increased by 0.81 percent compared to the previous year. For comparison, the GDP growth rate of China had reached about 7.3 percent that same year.Gross domestic product growth rate in Japan GDP serves as one of the most heavily relied upon indicators to gauge the state and health of a country’s economy. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a nation’s borders in a given period of time, usually a year. GDP figures allow a more fundamental understanding of a country’s economy. Year-on-year GDP growth acts as a helpful and clear sign of the direction in which a country is moving in economic terms. Real GDP is especially useful and insightful as it takes price changes (inflation and deflation) into account. The gross domestic product growth rate in Japan has been shaky since the recession of 2008 struck the world economy like a bolt out of the blue and Japan is still yet to gain a solid foothold. Despite its ongoing financial predicament however, Japan remains one of the world’s most highly developed economies. The economy of Japan is the third largest worldwide by nominal GDP and the nation has a very active manufacturing sector. It is active in the auto manufacturing sector, the third largest in the world after the United States and China, and has an electronics industry that is counted among the worlds most innovative. Japan can boast many titles, but perhaps the most significant to its future stability is that which relates to its astronomical national debts, currently running at over 200 percent of GDP, roughly 10.5 trillion US dollars.

The company's business segments include the motorcycle business, automobile business, financial services business, as well as power products and other businesses. 
 Global consumption of rice has seen a slight increase over the last several years. In the 2018/2019 crop year, about 490.27 million metric tons of rice was consumed worldwide, up from 437.18 million metric tons in the 2008/2009 crop year. Rice cultivation Rice requires specific growing conditions to be successfully cultivated. It must be grown in a flooded field in several inches of water. Once the unprocessed rice is harvested, it is known as paddy rice. In 2017, China produced 210.3 million metric tons of paddy rice, making that country the top producer of paddy rice worldwide. India had the largest harvest area of rice in the 2017/2018 crop year, at 43.79 million hectares, while China harvested 30.18 million hectares of rice in that year. Rice trade worldwide In addition to having the largest harvest area of rice, India also was the top exporter of rice in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. During that time period, India exported 12.5 million metric tons of rice. Despite being the top producer of rice worldwide, China’s consumption of rice cannot be satisfied by domestic production. China is also the top importer of rice of any country in the world, at over 4.5 million metric tons of rice. 
 The time series shows the net revenue of Amazon.com's e-commerce and service sales from 2004 to 2019, in billion US dollars. In the last reported year, the multinational e-commerce company's net revenue was 280.5 billion U.S. dollars, up from 177.86 billion US dollars in 2017. Amazon.com, an American electronic commerce company originally founded in 1994, is the world’s largest online retailer of books, clothing, electronics, music and many more goods. As of 2019, the company generates the majority of it's net revenues through online retail product sales, followed by third-party retail seller services, retail subscription services including Amazon Prime, and AWS. Amazon is also the producer of the leading e-book reader, the Amazon Kindle. Through Amazon, consumers are able to purchase goods at a rather discounted price from both small and large companies as well as from other users. Both new and used goods are sold on the website. Due to the wide variety of goods available at prices which often undercut local brick-and-mortar retail offerings, Amazon has dominated the retailer market. As of 2019, Amazon’s brand worth amounts to approximately almost 315 billion U.S. dollars, topping the likes of companies such as Walmart, Ikea, as well as digital competitors Alibaba and eBay. One of Amazon's first forays into the world of hardware was its e-reader Kindle, one of the most popular e-book readers worldwide. In recently years, Amazon has also released smartphone, tablets and multimedia sticks under it's Fire brand in order to increase digital media consumption via these devices. This strategy is connected to the digital Amazon ecosystem which features video and audio content as value-added services for Prime subscribers. Due to its location, Amazon offers more services in North America than worldwide. As a result, the majority of the company’s net revenue in 2019 was actually earned in the United States and Canada. In 2019, approximately 170.77 billion U.S. dollars was earned in North America compared to only roughly 74.7 billion U.S. dollars internationally. 
 This statistic represents the average price of bentonite between 2007 and 2019. In 2019, the average bentonite price stood at approximately 100 U.S. dollars per ton. Bentonite is a type of clay along with ball clay, common clay, and fire clay. Bentonite – additional informationBentonite is an absorbent aluminum phyllosilicate clay which is frequently generated from the alteration of volcanic ash. It consists predominantly of montmorillonite, a clay mineral. In 1898, Bentonite was first discovered in 1898 and classified in Fort Benton, Wyoming. Bentonite products have properties which give them a wide and diverse range of uses and applications. Its ability to expand in water is one of its most important properties, giving bentonite its voluminous and gelatinous mass. There are several different types of bentonite, such as, sodium bentonite, calcium bentonite and potassium bentonite. Sodium and calcium bentonites are primarily used for various industrial purposes. In iron and steel production processes, bentonite is widely used as a binding agent. For example, sodium bentonite is commonly used for large castings while calcium bentonite is more often used for smaller castings. The United States was one of the key producers of bentonite in 2016, followed by China and Greece. In 2019, the U.S. exported around 820 thousand metric tons of bentonite to other countries.Another common use of bentonite is as a cat litter, due to its advantage of absorbing refuse by forming clumps and leaving the rest of the product for further use. During the period from 1996 through 2014, bentonite was, by far, the most popular cat litter material used in North America and Europe. 
 This statistic shows the number of Facebook users in Malaysia from 2017 to 2023. In 2023, the number of Facebook users in Malaysia is expected to reach 24.2 million, up from 22 million in 2017. Further information With more than 2 billion monthly active users, Facebook is the most popular social network worldwide. Popular activities on the social network include watching videos, liking content via button, reading articles and messaging friends on 1-1 basis. In July 2016, Facebook Messenger surpassed one billion monthly active users, placing it directly next to Facebook-owned competitor WhatsApp. Facebook successfully managed the transition from social network to mobile social platform with mobile accounting for 97 percent of the social network’s total advertising revenue in 2016. Mobile is also the keyword regarding the online market in Malaysia; in 2016, 17.9 million people accessed the internet through their mobile phone. In 2021, this figure is projected to amount to 21.72 million mobile phone internet users. As of March 2017, the internet penetration in Malaysia was 67.7 percent. According to September 2016 data, 62 percent of the Malay population were active social media users. More than 17 million users access social media via mobile on a monthly basis, making it one of the biggest Facebook markets in the Southeast Asian region. The average internet connection speed in Malaysia is 6.4 Mbps, less than a quarter of market leader’s, South Korea’s, average speed of 29 Mbps. 
 This statistic shows the total population of Greece from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the total population of Greece was around 10.74 million people. Population of Greece After a subtle year-over-year increase from 2004 to 2011, the population of Greece has experienced a slight drop from 2011 until 2014. Population growth decreased marginally in 2011 compared to the previous year, and once again in 2012 in comparison to 2011. Greek women also bore fewer children per woman on average in 2011, a slight decrease from 2010. But a lower fertility rate is not necessarily the only reason for the country’s total population decline, Greece’s recent economic downturn also plays a role. Due to poor decisions in regards to spending made by the government, Greece has suffered through an economic crisis since 2010, diminishing the incentive to live in the country. The unemployment rate dramatically surged since the crisis, reaching a decade high in 2013. Additionally, the country’s GDP has significantly dropped in the same time frame from 2008 to 2013, with the largest slump in GDP growth occurring in 2011. Despite a severe economic slump, Greece still managed to maintain a relatively high HDI value in 2012, preserving a spot among the top 30 countries worldwide. The HDI, or Human Development Index, is based on parameters such as literacy rate, education levels, GNI and life expectancy, which was one of the highest in the world in 2011. 
 This graph shows the average number of people per family in the U.S. from 1960 to 2019. The average American family in 2019 consisted of 3.14 persons. Families in the United States According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a family is a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family. As of 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.48 million families in the United States. The average family consisted of 3.14 persons in 2019, down from 3.7 in the 1960s. This is reflected in the decrease of children in family households overall. In 1970, about 56 percent of all family households had children under the age of 18 living in the household. This percentage declined to 40.66 percent in 2019. The average size of a family household varies greatly from state to state. The largest average families can be found in Utah and Hawaii, with an average of 3.61 members respectively. The smallest families can be found in Vermont and Maine, with an average size of 2.88 and 2.85 members respectively. 
 This statistic shows the Ukrainian gross domestic product (GDP) from 1994 to 2018 in billion U.S. dollars, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, Ukraine's GDP amounted to approximately 130.86 billion U.S. dollars. See the Russian GDP for comparison. Ukraine's rocky economy In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, GDP in Ukraine has been dramatically reduced to half its amount. This very severe decrease is mainly due to the armed conflict in the eastern part of the country, which is causing many of its inhabitants to be internally displaced, and life in general to become increasingly difficult for Ukrainians - not just because of the war, but because the country’s economy is in desperate trouble: The inflation rate has risen to almost 50 percent, the second highest rate around the world behind Venezuela, and unemployment is now at over 11 percent. The industrial Donbass region located to the east of the country has also been devastated. Russia, Ukraine’s most important import and export partner until recently, most likely no longer plays this role, having caused a great shift in the country’s base economy. Ukraine’s national debt in relation to GDP is also unsustainable, having increased by over 50 percent in the last two years. Default or restructuring of its debt was inevitable, and eventually restructuring took place in August 2015. While the economy is expected to recover somewhat in 2016, its stability will depend on improving the stability of the country in order to create an environment in which the economy can operate and recover. 
 The statistic shows the average inflation rate in Turkey from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Turkey was at around 16.33 percent compared to the previous year. Turkey’s economy With a continuously growing gross domestic product /GDP and thus a rising share in the global GDP adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, Turkey’s economy is one of the largest worldwide. By 2030, Turkey is estimated to be one of the countries with the highest gross domestic product worldwide. Import of goods figures and export figures are rising as well, however, the trade balance of Turkey has been in the negative range for several years now with a downwards trend which indicates a serious trade deficit – or in other words: an imbalance between export and import costs; the value of goods Turkey imports is a lot higher than the value of exported goods. Main export partners of Turkey for textiles, automotive goods, iron and steel, among other goods, are mostly European countries, with Germany leading the ranking, followed by Iraq, Great Britain, Italy and France. The most important economic sector for Turkey is the services sector, especially the tourism sector, which has experienced a significant boost over the last decade. Thus, Turkey is now among the most popular destinations for visitors of all nations. A look at gross domestic product /GDP growth in Turkey shows that the country suffered a brief setback during the economic crisis of 2008, but swiftly recovered and was back in the black by 2010. Turkey’s employment figures hardly suffered at all, they too recovered quickly and are now back to pre-crisis levels. 
 This statistic shows the total lobbying spending in the United States from 1998 to 2019. In 2019, the total lobbying spending amounted to 3.47 billion U.S. dollars. Additional information on lobbying in the United States Since the turn of the millennium, the amount spent on lobbying in the United States has more than doubled. The intention of firms employing lobbyists, who in turn lobby government officials, is to gain a degree of influence on the legislative process in the hope of legislation more favorable to their business or cause being passed. Lobbying occurs at all levels from local government to presidential elections. The industries utilizing lobbying as a means to gain influence come from a range of industries with the biggest spenders including pharmaceuticals, insurance, business associations as well as oil and gas. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a pro business association, was the largest lobbying spender in 2018 by a considerable margin. Lobbying by the National Rifle Association has gained both domestic and global attention. Many observers have pointed to the lobby power of the National Rifle Association when attempting to explain the perceived lack of change in regards to gun control laws. Examples such as the national rifle association, alongside increasing lobbying spending, have lead to increased attention on the lobbying industry and the potential consequences of the industry’s increasing influence. Movements such as the Occupy Movement and protests against free-trade deals with other countries have called for restrictions on lobbying and the asymmetrical power it allows large corporations. 
 The District of Columbia had the highest robbery rate in the United States in 2017, with 343.8 robberies per 100,000 inhabitants. The lowest robbery rate in the country was found in Vermont, with 11.2 robbers per 100,000 inhabitants. Crime in the District of Columbia The violent crime rate in the District of Columbia was also the highest in the country in 2018, and there are a few reasons for this: Firstly, the population of the District of Columbia is quite low (causing a higher rate of crime), and secondly, issues such as the crack epidemic of the 1990s exacerbated the prevalence of crime in the District. As rising rents and gentrification force more people out of the District, crime is moving into neighboring Maryland and Virginia suburbs, as poorer residents seek more affordable living conditions. Crime in the United States Overall, violent crime in the United States and the District of Columbia today is far below the violent crime rate of the 1990s. While some may feel that crime is on the rise, due in part to media sensationalism, in fact the opposite is true, and the United States are becoming safer over time. 
 The statistic shows the average inflation rate in Canada from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket. This product basket contains products and services, on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Canada was approximately 2.24 percent compared to the previous year. For comparison, inflation in India amounted to 5.22 percent that same year. Inflation in Canada In general, the inflation rate in Canada follows a global trend of decreasing inflation rates since 2011, with the lowest slump expected to occur during 2015, but forecasts show an increase over the following few years. Additionally, Canada's inflation rate is in quite good shape compared to the rest of the world. While oil and gas prices have dropped in Canada much like they have around the world, food and housing prices in Canada have been increasing. This has helped to offset some of the impact of dropping oil and gas prices and the effect this has had on Canada´s inflation rate. The annual consumer price index of food and non-alcoholic beverages in Canada has been steadily increasing over the last decade. The same is true for housing and other price indexes for the country. In general there is some confidence that the inflation rate will not stay this low for long, it is expected to return to a comfortable 2 percent by 2017 if estimates are correct. 
 Gucci is one of the most iconic and well-known luxury personal goods brands in the world. The company operates all over the world. As of 2019, 38 percent of the Gucci’s revenues were generated in the Asia-Pacific market. How did Gucci’s product line develop? Gucci was founded in Florence, Italy in 1921. The company started out as a leather goods manufacturer, dealing primarily in the sale of leather bags to people travelling on horseback. As methods of transport changed, so too did Gucci’s product offering. The company started making luxury luggage and later added ties, shoes, and handbags to its product line. Gucci products turned into status symbols as many famous people started wearing them. Nowadays, Gucci offers a range of different luxury fashion products, with almost 60 percent of the brand’s worldwide revenue coming from the sale of leather goods as of 2019. Shoes, ready-to-wear apparel, watches, and jewelry are the other main product categories of Gucci, however they also sell other products such as perfume and home décor. Gucci: an iconic fashion labelGucci is one of the most valuable luxury good brands in the world. The company has changed ownership on a few occasions and is now part of the Kering Group. Gucci is the most well-known luxury fashion brand in the United States.
 Sports company Adidas was valued at over 16.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, an increase from around seven billion U.S. dollars in 2016. The multinational corporation is the second-largest sportswear company in the world. Adidas is in the game Footwear is a crucial product for Adidas, with over 50 percent of net sales generated by the category, selling 409 million pairs of shoes in 2018 alone. European football (soccer) is one of Adidas main focal points, with the brand sponsoring top clubs such as Manchester United, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid. The sports company is a recognized partners of the FIFA World Cup. Increasing brand presence in North America In recent years, Adidas increased its advertising spending in the United States, which may have been an influencing factor in the resulting increase in North American revenue. Customers' satisfaction increased as well; Adidas had the highest score of customer satisfaction for athletic shoe companies in the U.S., beating out rivals such as Nike and Puma. 
 The statistic depicts Greece's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth. In 2018, Greece's real GDP increased by about 1.93 percent compared to the previous year. Greece's national finances Greece is viewed as a high-income economy and experienced high economic and social growth and development between the 1950s and the 1970s, which was the highest rate in the world only behind Japan. However, due to the Great Recession in 2009 as well as the Greek government-debt crisis, Greek experienced severe hits to its already somewhat struggling economy. From the mid to late 2000s, national debt escalated severely but has, since 2012, remained relatively stable, primarily due to several debt restructuring deals as well as stimulus packages from countries within the EU. Different forms of financial aid were offered to Greece from countries within the European Union in order to help maintain the country from going completely dysfunctional to the point that Greece would no longer be able to pay back its debts. Greece’s economy primarily strives in the service sector and benefits exceptionally from its tourist industry. However, due to a failing tourist industry as well as struggles with properly managing imports and exports, struggles within the country are further increasing. More competent leadership, cutting costs as well as new structural reforms are necessary in order to slowly bring Greece back to an economically stable country. 
 The statistic shows the unemployment rate in South Korea from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the unemployment rate in South Korea was at around 3.84 percent. See the figures for the population of South Korea for comparison. Economy of South Korea South Korea is one of the world’s richest countries as well as a member of the G20, an organization made up of the 20 strongest economies in the world. Due to excessive growth from the 1960s to the 1990s, South Korea established itself as a developed country in the world with a strong economy and high wages. Continued economic growth is attributed to a robust export-oriented economy, which was deemed necessary for the country particularly due to a scarcity in natural resources as well as overpopulation in comparison to available living space. During the global financial crisis, South Korea surprised many economists by maintaining a stable economy and even experiencing economic growth, most notably during the peak of the crisis. Through stimulus packages as well as a high level of consumption, South Korea’s strong export-oriented economy was not affected as negatively as many other developed countries. South Korea’s economy primarily revolves around the production and export of technological goods. Some primary exports of the country include electronics, ships and automobiles. South Korea also has some of the largest shipbuilding companies worldwide, which are highly profitable but also have accumulated a rather large sum of debt over the course of several years. 
 The statistic above shows the average single copy price of U.S. magazines from 2000 to 2011. In 2005, the average single copy price of a magazine was 4.40 U.S. dollars. Here you can find data on average magazine circulation per issue. 
 This statistic gives information on the number of registered users of the chat-app LINE in selected countries as of October 2014. During that month, the Japanese chat app had 33 million users in Indonesia. International chat app Originally developed in Japan in the wake of the Tōhoku earthquake in March 2011, LINE app was created as an online messaging alternative that did not have to rely on Japan’s then-damaged telecommunications structure. The app was released to the public in 2011 and reached 100 million users only 18 months after its initial release. Apart from over-the-top messaging, LINE also offers free voice calls similar to Skype and thus provides an attractive alternative to paid mobile operating services. Furthermore, the app has also integrated social features such as timelines where users can post status messages to contacts. Aside from social networking features, LINE has also released a camera app and a gaming platform, LINE game. The in-app store of LINE enables users to purchase stickers that can be used similarly to emoji in chat discussions or to decorate photographs.

 This statistic illustrates the share of individuals using online banking regularly in Great Britain from 2007 to 2018. Banking and financial services are typically among the first industries to embrace technological advances; starting as far back in time as the appearance of automated teller machines (ATMs) and credit cards. Ever since the first secure Internet systems for financial operations became available on a large scale, accessing of one's bank account online to carry out transactions, pay off credit cards, establish credit lines or invest savings became one of the fastest growing areas of Internet activities. Mobile banking has become the new norm In the UK, online banking use increased during the period under observation: already 30 percent of respondents reported accessing their bank account online within three months prior to the survey in 2007. The growth in this activity area was steady over time, and the share rose to 69 percent of individuals who used online banking regularly as of 2018. In terms of device use for online banking, the smartphone was the preferred method.

Online banking in Europe Across Europe, the variation in the online banking penetration is huge. As of 2018, Nordic countries including Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden all had online banking penetration rates of over 80 percent. In stark contrast, North Macedonia, Romania and Bulgaria had penetration rates lower than 10 percent. 
 The statistic shows the inflation rate in France from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket. This product basket contains products and services on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. In 2018, the inflation rate in France was at about 2.1 percent compared to the previous year. The economy of France France is among the top six of the countries with the largest gross domestic product worldwide, behind the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, China and the United States. It is thus one of the leading economies worldwide. Its economy mostly relies on the services sector with almost 80 percent, agriculture making up only 1 percent of the economy and the industry sector the rest. These three sectors are typically seen as the main pillars of a country’s economy. France is also among the leading exporting countries worldwide and the leading importing countries worldwide. Both France’s exports and imports have increased over the last few years. Its trade balance (a country’s exports minus its imports) has been decreasing significantly over the last decade, which means the value of France’s exports was considerably lower than the value of its imports. France’s main exports include wine, meat and other food products. Its main imports are manufactured goods, among other products. As for the national finances, the national debt of France has been rising steadily and it is thus counted among the countries with the highest public debt, albeit lower in the ranking. Nevertheless, the standard of living in France is quite high, its life expectancy is among the highest in the world, and the employment rate has been steady, or even rising slightly, since 2009. 
 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Canadian dollar (EUR CAD), according to the data provided by the European Central Bank, starting from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until the 2019. This is the average, or standardized, measure; it denotes a calculation of average based on many observations throughout the period in question. It is different to the concrete (point in time) measure. The second one is used to show the exchange rate as it looked like in a specific point in time, for example at end of the month or end of the year, at closing. Between years 2009 and 2012, the exchange rate noted a sharp decline in value, with the annual average exchange rate of the euro to the Canadian dollar falling 1.59 to 1.29 by 2012. This meant that one euro could buy 1.29 Canadian dollars. This sharp decline was most likely associated with the volatile changes brought to the financial markets by the global recession. Since 2012, the annual average euro to Canadian dollar exchange rate has recovered to the level of 1.49 as of 2019; however it remains to be lower, compared to 1999, the first year of the observation. 
 Major League Baseball has a minimum player salary in place to ensure that its athletes are fairly compensated for the work they do. The MLB minimum salary in 2019 stood at a handsome 555 thousand U.S. dollars annually, representing a steady increase each year over the last 15 years. Money to be made in the MLB MLB players are known to receive generous yearly salaries, in addition to performance incentives, such as prizes for games won. The average player salary in 2019 was more than seven times higher than the minimum salary, at around 4.36 million U.S. dollars. This also represents almost double the average player salary from 2003, illustrating the rapid boom of money in baseball. However, there are large descrepancies between the salaries offered to players by different franchises. While players at the San Francisco Giants can expect to take home an average of 7.38 million U.S. dollars annually, professionals for the Oakland Athletics have to settle with just 2.09 million U.S. dollars a year on average. MLB's biggest earners Certain positions in the MLB, such as first base or starting pitcher, are usually better paid due to the important roles they are considered to have in the game. The highest paid players in the MLB in the 2019 season include Washington Nationals’ pitcher, Stephen Strasburg, and Arizona Diamondbacks’s pitcher, Zack Greinke, with an annual salary of over 34 million U.S. dollars each. In 2019, the Boston Red Sox were the best-paid baseball team in the MLB as the famous franchise based at Fenway Park had an opening day payroll of 213.19 million U.S. dollars. The Miami Marlins, on the other hand, were the most thrifty franchise with an opening day payroll of just under 63 million U.S. dollars. 
 This statistic depicts the price of rare earth oxide neodymium oxide globally from 2009 to 2025. It is expected that the price of neodymium oxide will reach some 94,438 U.S. dollars per metric ton in 2017. Until 2025, the price is expected to increase over 148 thousand dollars per metric ton. 
 The statistic shows the growth rate in the real GDP in the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the rate of GDP growth in the United Kingdom was at around 1.4 percent compared to the previous year.The economy of the United Kingdom GDP is used an indicator as to the shape of a national economy. It is one of the most regularly called upon measurements regarding the economic fitness of a country. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced in a country within a given period of time, usually a year. Inflation adjusted real GDP figures serve as an even more telling indication of a country’s economic state in that they act as a more reliable and clear tool as to a nation’s economic health. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in the United Kingdom has started to level in recent years after taking a huge body blow in the financial collapse of 2008. The UK managed to rise from the state of dark desperation it was in between 2009 and 2010, from -3.97 to 1.8 percent. The country suffered acutely from the collapse of the banking industry, raising a number of questions within the UK with regards to the country’s heavy reliance on revenues coming from London's financial sector, arguably the most important in the world and one of the globe’s financial command centers. Since the collapse of the post-war consensus and the rise of Thatcherism, the United Kingdom has been swept along in a wave of individualism - collective ideals have been abandoned and the mass privatisation of the heavy industries was unveiled - opening them up to market competition and shifting the economic focus to that of service. The Big Bang policy, one of the cornerstones of the Thatcher government programs of reform, involved mass and sudden deregulation of financial markets. This led to huge changes in the way the financial markets in London work, and saw the many old firms being absorbed by big banks. This, one could argue, strengthened the UK financial sector greatly and while frivolous and dangerous practices brought the sector into great disrepute, the city of London alone brings in around one fifth of the countries national income making it a very prominent contributor to wealth in the UK. 
 In 2019, over 50 percent of EU citizens voted in the European parliamentary elections, the highest voter turnout since 1994, when it was 56 percent. The highest turnout occurred in the first set of European parliamentary elections, held in 1979, in which 61.99 percent of eligible Europeans voted. Voter turnout declined in every election subsequent election however, reaching a low of 42.61 percent in 2014. Traditional parties maintain their majority in 2019 Although they run for national political parties during elections, European members of parliament are grouped into large pan-European political groups when they sit in the European Parliament. In the 2019 Elections the group that won the most seats was the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) which won 180 seats, followed by the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) which won 146 seats. Populist parties win big in Italy, France and the UK In three of the European Union’s largest countries, right-wing populist parties won the most seats in the European elections of 2019. In the United Kingdom the newly formed Brexit party led by Nigel Farage won 29 of the UK’s 73 seats in the European parliament, while in France Marine le Pen’s National Rally won 22 seats out of a possible 74. The League party in Italy, led by Matteo Salvini, managed to win 28 seats in Italy, an increase of 23 when compared with their performance in 2014. 
 This statistic depicts the total number of retail prescriptions filled annually in the United States from 2013 to 2025. It is estimated that in 2019, 4.38 billion retail prescriptions will be filled throughout the United States.U.S. Pharmacies and Drug Stores IndustryThe retail drug industry is comprised of pharmacies or drugstores, as they are known in North America. According to Statista estimates, which were calculated based on numbers presented by IBIS World, pharmacies and drugstores in the United States will generate a revenue of 257 billion U.S. dollars in 2014. With an aging population and greater prevalence of chronic diseases, the need for safe, legal pharmaceutical drugs is constantly rising.Pharmacies and drug stores dispense prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs directly to patients. However, their role is more than one of simple distribution as they dispense medication in specific doses, adhere to optimal conditions of storage and give valuable advice to patients. Pharmacies practice in a wide range of locations such as communities, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. Other drug retail outlets include supermarkets, and independent and online pharmacies, which offer mail-order drugs to patients, proving especially convenient for those that may be unable to leave their homes. In 2016, CVS Health was the leading drug store chain in the United States, based on retail prescription sales, generating approximately 60.8 billion U.S. dollars. Apart from selling drugs, miscellaneous products also account for a percentage of sales for these retail outlets, such as cosmetics and confectioneries.The retail drug store industry employs many different types of workers. Each store has a manager, along with department managers or assistant managers to handle additional administrative duties. Sales associates are generally entry-level retail workers. Pharmacists require a specialized degree and licensing to dispense medication. 
 The graph shows Toyota’s R&D costs from FY 2007 to FY 2018. Toyota incurred R&D costs of about one trillion Japanese yen in FY 2019. Japan-based Toyota Motor Corporation ranks among the largest automobile manufacturers in the world. Toyota’s research and development expenses Not only is the Toyota Motor Corporation Japan’s largest automotive manufacturer, it is also ranked as the number one carmaker worldwide in terms of automobile production. Japan had the highest public debt in relation to GDP in 2017. The weak yen has clearly helped Toyota export more vehicles: The Aichi-based carmaker exported a staggering 159,760 passenger cars in March 2018 alone. However, the company was hit hard by the 2008/2009 worldwide financial crisis, and its research and development expenses hit rock bottom in the fiscal year of 2010, only to finally reach pre-crisis levels in the fiscal year of 2014. In 2018, Toyota was among the top 20 companies with the highest spending on research and development. 
 This statistic shows the average net profit margin of the global mining industry represented by the top forty mining companies worldwide, from 2002 to 2018. In 2011, the net profit margin of the mining industry's leading companies was approximately 24 percent. Seven years later, in 2018, the net profit margin stood at ten percent. The net profit margin (also known as profit margin, net margin, net profit ratio) is a measurement to describe the profitability of a company. It is calculated by dividing the net income by the total revenue (or net profit by sales). For 2018, it means that the top 40 mining companies kept ten cents of profit out of every U.S. dollar they earned. Profits of top mining companies The average net profit margin of the world’s top 40 mining companies stood at some seven percent in 2014, but decreased to negative seven percent in 2015, and then rebounded to ten percent in 2018. These figures are a distinct decrease when compared to the years before. For example, in 2010, the profit margin stood at around 25 percent among the global top 40 mining firms. In 2018, the top 40 mining companies generated a net profit of approximately 66 billion U.S. dollars. As of that year, the company with the highest market capitalization was Austrialian/British mining giant BHP Billiton. The global top 40 mining companies, which represent the vast majority of the industry, generated more than half a trillion U.S. dollars of revenue in 2018. In terms of quantity, these companies produce most of all coal (including thermal and metallurgical coal), iron ore, and bauxite.

 This statistic shows the unemployment rate in the United States from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate among the United States population ranged at approximately 3.87 percent. Employment and economy in the United States The most notable surge in unemployment in the United States occurred between 2008 and 2009, and peaked in 2010. The United States was one of the countries most severely affected by the global financial crisis, primarily due to the crash originally materializing in the country. The crisis had a considerable effect on American households, most prominently on the labor market, which was also met with a significant decline in the stock market as well as the housing market. In order to stabilize and maintain a healthy economy, the United States government was inclined to absorb debt. The country’s national debt had increased yearly, however surged most remarkably in 2009 and has almost doubled in roughly 6 years since the crash. In order to determine if a country is able to pay back debt, the so-called debt-to-GDP ratio is used. It is often expressed as a percentage - the lower the percentage, the more likely a country can pay back debts without absorbing further debt. The United States’ debt-to-GDP ratio correspondingly began increasing in 2008, after experiencing an annual decline in the years prior, and is continuing to increase. Additionally, the United States maintained a budget deficit over the past decade, implying that its expenditures are higher than its revenues. This value has however significantly declined since 2009.

In comparison, Yukon had the lowest unemployment rate at 3.6 percent. Nunavut Nunavut is the largest and most northern province of Canada. Their economy is powered by many industries which include mining, oil, gas, hunting, fishing, and transportation. They have a high amount of mineral resources and many of their jobs come from mining, however, the territory still suffers from a high unemployment rate, which has fluctuated since 2004. The lack of necessary education, skills, and mobility are all factors that play a part in unemployment. Most of the population identifies as Inuit. Their official languages include English, French, and several Inuit languages. The capital is Iqaluit, which is their largest community and only city. The climate in Nunavut is a polar climate due to its high latitude, and as a result, it rarely goes above 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

 This statistic shows the total population of Italy from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the total population of Italy was around 60.48 million people. See Switzerland's population figures for comparison. The largest city in Italy, with the largest amount of inhabitants, is Rome, with almost 3 million inhabitants. Population of Italy Although the population in Italy has continuously grown year over year, population growth has significantly slowed down since 2004. It can be assumed that a decrease in population growth is related to a decrease in immigrants, especially considering that the fertility rate in the country has remained relatively stable over the past decade. A decrease in immigrants and a potential increase in emigrations could, in return, be a result of the country’s slumping economy. Many aspects of Italy’s economy have suffered as a result of the 2008 financial crisis: Italy’s unemployment rate has increased severely, most notably between 2011 and 2012 and this trend is expected to continue over the next several years. Additionally, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) has since decreased and has struggled to maintain stability. This is most evident in Italy’s real GDP growth rate. Not only is the growth rate minimal, but Italy has also experienced several years of negative growth, especially in 2009. However, despite a struggling economy, the standard of living in Italy has remained affluent. In 2012, Italy was ranked as one of the 30 countries with the highest Human Development Index rating. The Human Development Index, also known as the HDI, is based on values of life expectancy at birth, literacy rate, education levels and gross national income per capita. Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in the world as of 2011, ranking 6th out of the top 20 countries. 
 Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 23 percent of all deaths. Other leading causes of death include cancer, accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases. The leading causes of death worldwide are like those in the U.S. However, lung cancer, road injury, diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are all major causes of death worldwide, but are not among the leading causes in the U.S. Instead, accidents, influenza and pneumonia, intentional self-harm and kidney diseases have a larger impact in the U.S. Racial differences In the United States, there exist slight differences in leading causes of death depending on race and ethnicity. For example, assault, or homicide, accounts for around 3 percent of all deaths among the black population but is not even among the leading causes of death for other races and ethnicities. However, heart disease and cancer are still the leading causes of death for all races and ethnicities. Gender differences Similarly, there are also differences in the leading causes of death in the U.S. depending on gender. For example, among males, intentional self-harm accounts for around 2.5 percent of all deaths but is not among the leading causes of death among females. On the other hand, septicemia and influenza and pneumonia account for more deaths among women than men.

 This statistic presents information on the projected mobile app store revenues from 2015 to 2020. In 2015, global mobile app revenues amounted to 69.7 billion U.S. dollars. In 2020, mobile apps are projected to generate 188.9 billion U.S. dollars in revenues via app stores and in-app advertising. As of March 2017, there were some 2.8 million apps available in Google Play, the world’s largest app store, while the Apple Store, the second ranked, boasted some 2.2 million available apps in January 2017. As mobile apps become more popular and mobile internet more widely available, revenues generated from applications are reaching unprecedented records. There are a number of different ways in which to generate revenues from apps, including simply charging users a small amount of money per download, but this is not the most popular monetization models among worldwide mobile developers, which claim to use it in some 20 percent of the cases. In fact, statistics show that the number of apps in Google’s Play Store that charge for download has decreased 2015 compared to previous years. A variant of this model is the upgrade, where a free application will offer users the possibility to upgrade to a more enhanced or ad-free version of their product in exchange of a fee. The most widely used revenue stream is advertising, but, according to developers, also the most hated . In-app advertising revenues are set to reach 117.2 million U.S. dollars in 2020, up from 40.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2015.

 This statistic shows the development of the gross domestic product of the United States of America from 1990 to 2019. Gross domestic product (GDP) refers to the market value of all goods and services produced within a country. The U.S. GDP increased to about 21.4 trillion U.S. dollars in 2019. The annual growth rate of the Real GDP can be found here. Currently, the United States is ranked first in the world GDP ranking. See, for example, the Russian GDP for comparison. U.S. Finances The gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most important indicators used to analyze the health of an economy. GDP is defined by the BEA as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States, regardless of nationality. It is the primary measure of U.S. production. The OECD defines GDP as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident, institutional units engaged in production (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs). Although the United States had the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the world in 2019, the national debts of the United States are rising steadily. The national debt of the United States amounted to 18.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2014 and grew up to 21.5 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018. A ranking of individual state debt in the United States shows that California is the state with the highest amount of debt in the United States, while New York was on rank 2, New York’s debt amounted to 387.47 billion U.S. dollars. Vermont, North Dakota and South Dakota are the states with the lowest amount of debt. The U.S. government receives a part of its budget from taxpayers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the American government’s tax revenue was about 1.03 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018. Since 2002, the total amounts of the receipts are lower than the amount of the outlays of the United States and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget forecast that the gap between the receipts and outlays of the United States will only continue to widen. The result of this development is that the U.S. won't be able to reduce the national debt within the coming decade.

It is considered to be a very important indicator of the economic strength of a country and a positive change is an indicator of economic growth. In 2018, the estimated GDP per capita in Brazil amounted to around 8,958.58 U.S. dollars. For further information see GDP of Brazil. Economical future of Brazil GDP per capita is worked out by taking the country’s total gross domestic product and dividing it by the total population, which essentially helps determine growth of an economy as well as changes in productivity for every person living in the country. As a member of economic organizations such as the G20 as well as the BRIC countries, Brazil has certainly made its mark as one of the strongest economies in the world. Despite experiencing economic fluctuations often, the general direction of the Brazilian economy is mainly positive. With recent improvements within the government, bank and education systems, Brazil has become a slightly more significant option for international investments. Additionally, a profusion of natural resources, a strong agricultural and industrial sector, and a growing service sector has made investors more intrigued in the future of the country. Additionally, at the end of 2014, consumer confidence saw a slight, however noticeable improvement, implying that individual financial situations and hope for the future of the country are very present within the country. Shortly after, consumer confidence plummeted, showing little faith in Brazil's economic future. However, the economic benchmarks point in a different direction. 
 This statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Russia from 1994 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. In 2018, the GDP per capita in Russia was around 11,289.44 U.S. dollars. See the Russian GDP for comparison. Russia's wealth Russia generates most of its wealth through its energy sector, given that a large percentage of its industrial and agricultural sectors have been privatized in the 1990s. The majority of Russia’s exports consisted of natural resources, such as oil, gas and metals. Russia’s primary export partners are located within Europe, with the exception of China, and are often the recipients of a large amount of Russia’s natural gas exports. The country’s second most important and influential sector is the military sector, due to having built up a complex arms industry and having the proficiency to produce high tech weapons. Russia ranks as one of the highest spenders for military production and is one of the more intimidating military powers in the world. Due to the privatization of Russia’s industrial and agricultural sectors, a rather large part of the population was able to capitalize on the market. Russia is home to one of the highest numbers of billionaires in the world, trailing only countries such as the United States and China. 
 The statistic shows GDP in India from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, GDP in India was at around 2.72 trillion US dollars. See figures on India's economic growth here, and the Russian GDP for comparison. Economic liberalization on the Indian subcontinent Of all the factors and empirical data that give an insight into the shape of a national economy, there aren’t as many indicators more telling than GDP. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a year. Real GDP figures serve as an even more reliable tool in estimating in which direction a country’s economy may be heading, as they are adjusted for inflation and reflect real price developments. The decision of the newly independent Indian government to adopt a mixed economy, adopting both elements of both capitalist and socialist systems, resulted in huge inefficiencies borne out of the culture of interventionism that was a direct result of the lacklustre implementation of policy and failings within the system itself. The desire to move towards a Soviet style mass planning system failed to gain much momentum in the Indian case due to a number of hindrances, an unskilled workforce being one of many. When the government of the early 90’s saw the creation of small scale industry in large numbers due to the removal of price controls, the economy started to bounce back, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union - India’s main trading partner - the hampering effects of socialist policy on the economy were exposed and it underwent a large scale liberalization. By the turn of the 21st century, India was rapidly progressing towards a free-market economy. India’s development has continued and it now belongs to the BRIC group of fast developing economic powers. 
 This statistic shows the number of tornadoes in the United States from 1995 to 2019. In 2019, there were a total 1,520 tornadoes reported in the United States. 
 This statistic shows the development in the average number of employees at H&M worldwide from 2005 to 2019. In 2019, H&M had an average of 126,376 employees worldwide. H&MH&M is a leading global fashion company with strong values and a clear business concept.

 The time series shows the projected net revenue of Amazon.com's e-commerce and service from 2002 to 2022, in billion US dollars. In the last measured year fiscal period, the multinational e-commerce company's net revenue was 136 billion U.S. dollars, up from 107 billion U.S. dollars in 2015. Amazon.com, an American electronic commerce company originally founded in 1994, is the world’s largest online retailer of books, clothing, electronics, music and many more goods. As of 2016, the company generates the majority of it's net revenues through online retail product sales, followed by third-party retail seller services, retail subscription services including Amazon Prime, and AWS. Amazon is also the producer of the leading e-book reader, the Amazon Kindle. Through Amazon, consumers are able to purchase goods at a rather discounted price from both small and large companies as well as from other users. Both new and used goods are sold on the website. Due to the wide variety of goods available at prices which often undercut local brick-and-mortar retail offerings, Amazon has dominated the retailer market. As of 2016, Amazon’s brand worth amounts to approximately almost 100 billion U.S. dollars, topping the likes of companies such as Walmart, Ikea, as well as digital competitors Alibaba and eBay. One of Amazon's first forays into the world of hardware was its e-reader Kindle, one of the most popular e-book readers worldwide. In recently years, Amazon has also released smartphone, tablets and multimedia sticks under it's Fire brand in order to increase digital media consumption via these devices. This strategy is connected to the digital Amazon ecosystem which features video and audio content as value-added services for Prime subscribers. Due to its location, Amazon offers more services in North America than worldwide. As a result, the majority of the company’s net revenue in 2016 was actually earned in the United States and Canada. In 2016, approximately 79.79 billion U.S. dollars was earned in North America compared to only roughly 43.98 billion U.S. dollars internationally. 
 More than half of the world’s population identify as feminists - in India alone, over 80 percent of respondents very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists. Surprisingly, this number is much lower in developed countries like the United States or Germany (with not even 40 percent of respondents agreeing), which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully – has. But are some really more equal than others? Despite its deceptive title, feminism is not about establishing superiority of women – its core concept is equality for all, no matter their sex, gender, or orientation. Achieving this equality means championing women with more force and verve than has been done before, since today’s societies are deeply patriarchal – i.e. they favor men over women. Critics often misinterpret this support of women as an attempt to suppress and attack men – when in fact, feminism and equality for all benefits them as well. The country of the poets and thinkers seems stuck In Germany, feminism is on the rise, but traditional gender roles and insufficient information still hinder progress. Only a third of German women, and even fewer German men, define themselves as feminist, while at the same time, over 70 percent of women and almost 60 percent of men would agree that gender equality is important to them. Still, they are not convinced that discrimination against women is ending anytime soon. Most of all, they say, reallocating responsibility and adjusting payrolls would help to achieve a feminist society. 
 The statistic shows the unemployment rate in Japan from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate in Japan was at about 2.41 percent. Employment and the economy in Japan Japan is one of the leading countries when it comes to economic key factors; its unemployment rate, for example, is lower than that of other major industrial and emerging countries. The Japanese work ethic is well-known worldwide, it is synonymous with a strong devotion to the company and to the task at hand; competition among co-workers and loyalty to the company are common and encouraged, working hours and over-time work are said to be excessive. The Japanese language even has its own term for sudden death from being overworked – “Karoshi”. After the devastating effects of World War II, Japan managed to recover economically and even earn a prominent role among other leading economic powers – a fact which is probably partly due to this attitude towards work and employment. Today, Japan is among the leading import countries worldwide, as well as the leading export countries worldwide. Additionally, Japan is one of the 20 countries with the largest proportion of the global domestic product, and also among the 20 countries with the largest gross domestic product per capita, even though it is also ranked tenth among the leading countries with the largest population. 
 The graph shows the number of employed people in China from 2008 to 2018. In 2018, the workforce in China had amounted to around 775.9 million people.Workforce in China – additional information In 2017, China’s total population had reached 1.39 billion. The labor force of China, which refers to the population aged 16 and over and capable of working, stood at 806 million in 2018, marking a slight decrease of one million people from 2017. Out of the economically active population, approximately 776 million had been employed in 2018. As of 2018, there were about 43.4 billion people employed in urban areas, while 342 million people had been working in rural areas. Although the workforce in China had been steadily increasing, the labor force participation rate in China, meaning the share of the Chinese working-age population that participated in the labor force had slightly decreased, dropping from 72.3 percent in 2007 to 68.9 percent in 2017. Between 2008 to 2018, the share of the workforce employed in the primary sector had declined significantly in China from 39.6 percent in 2008 to 26.1 percent in 2018, whereas the percentage of people employed in the secondary and tertiary sectors increased. As of 2018, about 27.6 percent of Chinese workers had been employed in secondary and 46.3 percent in tertiary industries.Partly influenced by the implementation of the one-child policy, the fertility rate in China has receded, resulting in a demographic shift of the age pyramid and, in turn, of the overall workforce. 
 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in South Korea from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in South Korea amounted to about 1.48 percent compared to the previous year. For further info, see the South Korean GDP. South Korea's low inflation High rates of inflation are undesireable, just like low rates, and South Korea is currently struggling with the latter. South Korea is actually an affluent country and currently ranks 11th on the list of the 20 countries with the largest GDP, but its inflation rate is subject to concern, as it is currently at levels below 2 percent. However, there is still hope that inflation will return to stable rates between 3 and 4.5 percent in the next few years, and there are also signs that consumer confidence is rising after two years of weak economic growth and sluggish domestic consumption and investment. The unemployment rate remains low with levels staying in the range of 3 percent - close to full employment – yet there are still obstacles including an aging population and a heavy reliance on exports. At present, South Korea is attempting to balance its reliance on exports by expanding the service industry, especially as the export market slows. 
 This statistic shows the unemployment rate of Iran from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, Iran's unemployment rate was estimated to amount to 11.99 percent of the total labor force. Employment and economy in Iran Iran’s unemployment rate has been above 10 percent for the last 10 years, and this rate is estimated to have peaked in 2014, when estimates reached 14 percent. Also, many of those who are considered employed in Iran are also considered underemployed. Unemployment in Iran is especially high among young people and women; over 70 percent of the population’s close to 80 million inhabitants are of working age, increasing the overall demand of these inhabitants for work. Iran’s economy has also been in a recession, which has exacerbated the difficulties to meet the employment demands of its inhabitants. Although the economy is expected to recover slightly in 2014, Iran's GDP is expected to decrease and the real GDP growth rate is either negative or quite low. In times of a struggling economy, it is typically more difficult to create jobs and introduce people to the labor force. Because Iran's economic activity still depends to a large extent on oil revenues, this also reduces the stability of the economy and employment. With a decreasing per capita GDP and a high inflation rate people are also more vulnerable to changes in income and employment, making the unemployment a pressing issue that the country will have to manage. 
 The statistic shows Mexico’s GDP from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, Mexico’s GDP amounted to approximately 1.22 trillion US dollars.Economy of Mexico GDP is an indicator primarily used to gauge the state and health of a national economy. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within national borders in a given period of time, usually a year. GDP gives us an insight into a country’s economic development over a period of time, how its development fits in with international shifts and how it is affected by the factors that affect market economies. The demand among some segments of the Chinese workforce for fairer payment, coupled with higher transportations costs, have been key factors in increasing the competitiveness of Mexican manufacturing, with some suggestions being made that it is already cheaper than China for the many industries that serve the lucrative United States market. The Mexican economy is, however, far from trouble-free. And although the gross domestic product in Mexico has been increasing, it is showing that it is struggling to match up to the fast pace of growth and prosperity being seen in some of the BRIC countries, as well as the usual suspects of economic success, the United States, Canada and others. Inequality in Mexico remains a huge problem. The education system in the federation’s thirty-one states is in dire need of reform, and in some of the states, especially in those closest to the US border, brutal criminal drug lords'rule. It is important for Mexicans that they embrace the opportunity that they find themselves presented with at present and harness the energy of their large population , the newly arrived foreigners and their educated youth, in order to provide the country with the future prosperity that it most desperately needs.

The brand is considered to be a status symbol for design, comfort and reliability. 
 Manchester United had an average attendance of 74,879 for their home games in the 2018/19 season, their lowest since 2009/10. Despite the fall in numbers, Manchester United had the highest average attendance of all 20 English Premier League clubs in 2018/19. The Theatre of Dreams Manchester United play their homes games at the largest stadium in the English Premier League: Old Trafford. The venue has a capacity of around 76,000 for soccer games, meaning the stadium is around 99 percent full for each home fixture. Manchester United have won an English record 20-top division titles, but were last crowned champions of England in 2012/13 – the club’s longest run without a league title since the English Premier League was formed in 1992/93. The average attendance at Old Trafford fell despite the cheapest matchday ticket for Manchester United being a competitively priced 31 British pounds in the 2018/19 season; the recent performances of the team may be one reason why some supporters were not tempted through the turnstiles. Glory glory Man United In financial terms, the club continues to grow regardless of recent on-field failings. The total revenue of Manchester United increased to around 776 million U.S. dollars in 2018, helped by annual rises in sponsorship revenue. Despite a relatively short league title drought, the club can still attract global partners and sign lucrative contracts because sponsors want to be associated with a brand that was ranked the third most valuable soccer club worldwide in 2019 – only Spanish sides Real Madrid and Barcelona had a greater value. 
 This timeline shows a forecast for global retail sales growth from 2017 to 2023. In 2019, global retail sales were expected to grow by 4.5 percent. Global retail sales were projected to amount to around 29.8 trillion U.S. dollars by 2023, up from approximately 23 trillion U.S. dollars in 2017. American retailers worldwide As a result of globalization and various trade agreements between markets and countries, many retailers are capable of doing business on a global scale. Many of the world’s leading retailers are American companies. Walmart and Amazon are examples of such American retailers. The success of U.S. retailers can also be seen through their performance in online retail. Retail in the U.S. The domestic retail market in the United States is a lucrative market, in which many companies compete. Walmart, a retail chain offering low prices and a wide selection of products, is the leading retailer in the United States. Amazon, The Kroger Co., Costco, and Target are a selection of other leading U.S. retailers. 
 The statistic shows global gross domestic product (GDP) from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, global GDP amounted to about 84.93 trillion U.S. dollars. Gross domestic product Gross domestic product, also known as GDP, is the accumulated value of all finished goods and services produced in a country, often measured annually. GDP is significant in determining the economic health, growth and productivity in the country, and is a stat often used when comparing several countries at a time, most likely in order to determine which country has seen the most progress. Global GDP has experienced a growth every year over the past decade with the exception of 2009. However, a strong growth rate does not necessarily lead to all positive outcomes and often has a negative affect on inflation rates. A severe growth in GDP leads to less unemployment, however lower unemployment often leads to higher inflation rates due to demand increasing at a much higher rate than supply and as a result prices rise accordingly. Despite a relatively high global GDP growth, unemployment only marginally changed over the course of 5 years and is forecasted to remain stagnant going into 2017. Unemployment, however, is often difficult to predict, primarily now since most economies are still recovering from the 2008 global financial crisis. 
How much are acrylic nails in the U.S.? Nail salons in the U.S. charged an average price of 46.01 U.S. dollars for a full set of acrylics in 2019. Nail salons in the U.S. The nail salon industry in the United States is a large and thriving industry, which is active across all 50 states. However, the accessibility and types of clients have changed drastically since the early 20th century. In the early 1900s, nail salons were accessible to only wealthy women. Over the next two decades, it became possible to buy nail polish in stores. Having a manicured hand was a sign of wealth and social status during that time period. In today’s society, manicures and pedicures are available to everyone. As a result of this, there has been an increased amount of spending on nail salon services from 1998. However, the number of nail salons in the United States has decreased since 2006. On the other hand, the number of nail technicians has increased. Manicurists and pedicurists make about one third of what theatrical and performance makeup artists make, who are the highest paid employees in personal appearance services in the United States. Nail services Acrylics are one of the many services offered at nail salons. Acrylic nails are a mix of powder and liquid product, which are shaped into a soft ball and then formed into a nail shape. The acrylic is applied to the nail then hardened to become stronger, then painted with nail polish. The average price for an acrylic fill has steadily increased from 2006 to 2019. Acrylic nail upkeep requires coming to the nail salon about every two weeks. 
 As of 2005, people in the United States stated that they have had an average of 10.7 sexual partners, which is slightly above the global average of nine sexual partners. Turkey in the lead? Surveys on sensitive or very personal topics, like sexuality, are often to be taken with a grain of salt, but in this case, Turkey did not only lead the ranking in 2005, it also topped the one conducted in 2010 on the mean number of sexual partners. So is it likely that the Turkish people are sexually more prolific than everybody else? Another survey by another source suggests otherwise: It does not include Turkey when it comes to the countries with the most sexually active inhabitants but lists the Greek as the most active ones. In general, people tend to embellish their own activities, but also those of others – the disparity between the perceived and the actual number of times people have sex is staggering and similar everywhere around the world. India the most monogamous? Of those countries surveyed, Indian respondents report the lowest average number of sexual partners, only slightly surpassed by China. Both China and India struggle with a significant difference between the number of men and the number of women, and both countries largely adhere to conservative standards of sexuality that prohibit sex before marriage. 
 This graph depicts the average regular season home attendance of the Seattle Seahawks from 2008 to 2019. In 2019, the average attendance at home games of the Seattle Seahawks was 68,990. Seattle Seahawks average home attendance - additional information The Seattle Seahawks’ average regular season home attendance has remained relatively constant in recent years, with the average in the 2019 season standing at 68,990. This figure puts the team almost above average compared to the entire NFL average, which was recorded as 66,151 in 2019. The Dallas Cowboys were the best supported team throughout the 2019 regular season as an average of over 90,000 fans watched each of their home games. The average attendance of the Seahawks was ranked 15th out of the 32 teams in the NFL. A total of 16.67 million people attended regular season games in the 2019 NFL season, over 551,000 of whom passed through the gates of CenturyLink Field, home of the Seahawks. Each of these Seahawks fans paid an average of 111.79 U.S. dollars to watch their team in the 2019 season, a figure that increased from under 97 U.S. dollars for the previous season. The Seahawks have enjoyed considerable success in recent years, making the playoffs in the 2010 and 2012 seasons. The franchise then went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014, beating the Denver Broncos 43-8. This marked the team’s first Super Bowl win in its history, having previously lost Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2005. CenturyLink Field was opened as the Seahawks Stadium in July 2002 but was renamed Qwest Field in June 2004 when the telecommunications carrier acquired the naming rights. Its current name was adopted in June 2011 after the takeover of Qwest by CenturyLink. It is also home to MLS team, Seattle Sounders FC, which began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. 
 This statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) in France from 1984 to 2018, with a projection up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. In 2018, the GDP in France was around 2.78 trillion U.S. dollars. Economy of France France is an economically developed nation and one of the members of the G7. France is also considered to be one of the leading countries in Europe, often seen as the second most important nation in the European Union behind Germany. France has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP), being one of the top 10 countries with the largest GDP in the world in 2014. Despite this, the country is still ranked in the top 20 in regards to its public debt compared to its GDP in the same year. A high debt-to-GDP ratio demonstrates a country’s ability to produce and sell goods and services in order to be able to pay back its debts, however producing and selling these goods should not result in more debts. France’s national debt slightly increased year-over-year up until 2014, most notably between 2008 and 2009. Additionally, France reported a large trade deficit in 2012, a value almost 5 times larger compared to the previous year, indicating that the country is importing much more than it is exporting. This often leads to higher debts due to a need to borrow more money to produce goods. 
 This statistic represents the number of bus registrations in the United States in 2017, by federal state, including the District of Columbia. With around 99,900 registered buses, California was ranked first. 
 This statistic shows the national debt of Ireland from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the national debt of Ireland was around 226.92 billion U.S. dollars. For comparison, the Greek debt amounted to approximately 303 billion euros that same year. In a ranking of debt to GDP per country, Ireland is thus currently ranked tenth, while Greece is ranked second. Ireland and the economic crisis Ireland has been severely affected by the economic crisis owing mainly to the bursting of its real estate bubble in 2007. The crisis led to a dramatic decline in real estate prices and was a major factor in the financial and banking crisis, causing Ireland to enter recession in 2008 – which means that the economy underwent a period of decline, unemployment figures soared, numerous bankruptcies resulted and many businesses were forced into closure, and inflation and GDP declined. Ireland’s budget balance seems to be in remission from a severe state deficit in 2010. It continues to show negative figures to this day. Ireland was not the only country to be hit severely by the economic crisis, other countries are also suffering: Portugal, for example, reported an ever higher national debt than Ireland in 2012 and an even higher state deficit. Spain is another casualty; it has been reporting extraordinarily high unemployment figures since 2008, the rate of unemployment is still on the rise . The country suffering most due to the economic crisis, however, was and still is Greece, with a national debt almost one-and-a-half times as large as Ireland’s at times, and an unemployment rate to rival that of Spain, as well as a devastated economy. As for Ireland, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) agreed to support the country financially with a loan in 2010. However, the country is still not out of recession and might struggle to secure economic recovery for another few years at least. 
 The statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Canada from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the gross domestic product per capita in Canada was around 46,290.22 U.S. dollars. Canada's economy GDP per capita is a measurement often used to determine economic growth and potential increases in productivity and is calculated by taking the GDP and dividing it by the total population in the country. In 2014, Canada had one of the largest GDP per capita values in the world, a value that has grown continuously since 2010 after experiencing a slight downturn due to the financial crisis of 2008. Canada is seen as one of the premier countries in the world, particularly due to its strong economy and healthy international relations, most notably with the United States. Canada and the United States have political, social and economical similarities that further strengthen their relationship. The United States was and continues to be Canada’s primary and most important trade partner and vice versa. Canada’s economy is partly supported by its exports, most notably crude oil, which was the country’s largest export category. Canada was also one of the world’s leading oil exporters in 2013, exporting more than the United States. Additionally, Canada was also a major exporter of goods such as motor vehicles and mechanical appliances, which subsequently ranked the country as one of the world’s top export countries in 2013. 
 Between 1990 and 2019, the film studio with the most ‘Best Picture’ Academy Awards was Universal, having won five awards over the twenty year period. Second and third in the ranking were Miramax and Warner Bros with four ‘Best Picture’ awards each. Universal Pictures Universal Pictures was founded in 1912 and has also been known as Universal Film Manufacturing Company and Universal Studios. The studio is part of the Hollywood ‘Big Five’ along with Paramount, Warner Bros, Walt Disney and Columbia. Universal has released some of the world’s most well-known movies, including ‘Despicable Me’, ‘Jurassic Park’ and ‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’, all of which proved successful at box offices in North America and across the globe. Both the ‘Jurassic Park’ and ‘Despicable Me’ franchises made the list of highest grossing film franchises and series worldwide, earning 4.98 and 3.71 billion U.S. dollars respectively. In 2018, Universal’s box office market share in North America was almost 15 percent, and the studio’s releases earned over one billion U.S. dollars in North America that year. 
 This graph shows the average age of cars on the road in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2000 and 2016, including projections for 2015 and 2016. It can be seen that before the recession the average age of cars in the UK was falling, however, since the recession the average age has risen drastically and will probably continue to rise. These figures show that people were preferring to hold onto their cars for longer rather than sell them to buy new cars. Comparing the projected average age of cars on the road in the UK in 2015 with the average age of light commercial vehicles and the average age of buses in use in Great Britain in 2015, shows that the average age of these vehicles is slightly higher than the age of cars on the road. On the other hand, the average age of auctioned cars in the UK in 2015 was slightly lower than the average age of cars on the road in 2015. 
 The average size of farms in the United States has seen a steady increase over the last decade. In 2018, the average farm size reached 443 acres, up from 418 acres in 2007. Between 2006 and 2007 there was a sudden drop in average farm size, but in recent years it has recovered and once again reached the same levels as its peak in 2006. Agriculture in the United States In 2018 there were about 2.03 million farms in the United States, down from 2.2 million in 2007. It appears that as average farm size has increased, the number of individual farms in the United States has decreased. Texas is home to the highest number of farms of any U.S. state, with 248,000 farms as of 2018. Major Crops in the United States The United States produces a wide variety of crops. Though the production volumes of some major crops, such as wheat, have fluctuated considerably since 2000, the production of vegetables for processing has been on the rise in recent years. Grapes, apples, and oranges are the most produced fruits in the United States, with the majority of grapes being grown in California.

 Founded in Sweden in 2003, King is a video game developer that is most famous for its blockbuster gaming hit, Candy Crush Saga. The developer’s revenue reached two billion U.S. dollars in 2018, a marked increase from revenue of less than 60 million U.S. dollars in 2010. King of the developers In its early years in the social gaming world, King relied on in-game advertising and micro-transactions to generate revenue. The latter enabled players to make in-game purchases to improve their virtual world or help them past a particularly tricky level. However, in a move to win over its legion of fans, the company decided to remove all in-game advertising in June 2013 and focused on micro-transactions to bring in the money. This strategy seemed to pay off as the monthly active users of King continued to increase and peaked at 550 million users at the beginning of 2015. However, the MAU figure has been steadily falling in the ensuing years and the company was acquired in February 2016 by Activision Blizzard, famed for games such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch, in a deal worth almost six billion U.S. dollars. The publisher has since seen an upturn in its fortunes and registered record operating income of 750 million U.S. dollars in 2018. Candy Crush Saga – King’s jewel in the crown The more than tenfold increase of King’s revenue between 2012 and 2013 is down to just one game – Candy Crush Saga. The colorful puzzle game became an overnight sensation and could be seen on smartphones across the world. While the game itself is free-to-play, users have the option of making in-game purchases to help them get past certain levels. This is where King’s micro-transaction revenue model truly paid off as player spending in Candy Crush mobile games worldwide reached over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Despite the fast-paced nature of mobile gaming and the new releases that hit our screens every day, Candy Crush Saga still remains one of the most popular free-to-play games on the market. 
 The statistic depicts the average inflation rate in Mexico from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate measures price changes for a fixed basket of goods which includes a representative selection of goods and services. In 2018, Mexico's average inflation rate was around 4.9 percent compared to the previous year. Mexico’s economy Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP) has been increasing slightly over the last decade, however, its national debt still amounts to almost half of its GDP. The majority of Mexico’s GDP is yielded by the services sector, as a look at the distribution of gross domestic product in Mexico by sector shows. More than 60 percent of GDP are generated in this sector; the majority of the Mexican workforce is employed in services. One important contributor to Mexico’s GDP is tourism. The total unemployment rate in Mexico took a turn for the worse during the recession of 2008 and is still to bounce back to previous levels. Mexico’s main export and import partner is the United States which accounts for approximately half of the value of both. Thus, the trade balance of goods in Mexico, showing the value of exports minus the value of imports, is heavily dependant on the United States. For the past decade, Mexico’s trade balance has run at a deficit of more than 10 billion US dollars. The trade balance of services sector in Mexico has also been in the red with a deficit of more than 6 percent since the recession and higher than 9 percent since 2011. Mexico is also one of the largest drug exporting countries worldwide. Specific trade figures are not available, however, Mexico is among the top countries for opium cultivation based on acreage, and thousands of illegal poppy fields, processed into opium, have been destroyed in Mexico year after year.

 The statistic shows the number of deaths due to terrorism worldwide between 2006 and 2018. 32,836 people were killed by terrorists in 2018. The number of terrorist attacks worldwide declined between 2006 and 2017. In 2006, about 14,371 terrorist attacks were counted, while in 2018, 8,093 terrorist attacks were counted. Terrorism is often defined as unlawful violence or systematic use of terror against civilians or politicians for ideological or political reasons, with the intention to create fear. Terrorism is practiced by nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. The fear of terrorism is still instilled in many people's minds. According to Gallup’s survey, which was conducted among adults in the United States in 2013, 34 percent of the participants stated that they were very worried about the possibility of future terrorist attacks. Only 10 percent of the participants said that they were not at all worried.

 Over 2,300 homicides were gang-related in the United States in 2012. This was the highest amount since 2007 and a reversal of a negative trend from the previous two years. Violent crime Violent crime in the United States is not limited to gang violence, but the murders in this statistic compose a significant portion of the number of reported murders in those years. While there were many arrests for violent offenses in those years, few were gang members. Still, gang-related violence is a serious problem. Ways to die Gang-related killings are among the top circumstances for murders in the United States. Also enlightening is the number of murder victims by weapon. The vast majority of U.S. murder victims were killed by handguns or a type of firearm. The source does not give how many murders were averted by guns. 
 During an September 2019 survey, it was found that 25 percent of teens in the United States used Instagram the most out of all social networks. This is hardly surprising, as U.S. teens rated Instagram among their favorite social network for the past few years. In spring 2019, 35 percent of teenagers ranked the photo-sharing app as their most important social network. Teens and social media in the United States As evidenced by exasperated parents and teachers everywhere, social media is one of the most popular online activities among teenagers in the United States. Despite the near-constant social media usage, teens are usually reasonably aware of the time they spent online. During an April 2018 survey, 54 and 41 percent of responding teens stated that they spent too much time on their cellphone and on social media respectively. Due to constant interaction with other people online, teens come across a wide range of personalities. The most common personality types that teens come across social media are oversharers (people who share too many personal details on social media) and ranters (people who rant and complain about things a lot). Social media and emotional well-being One of the key benefits of social media is that it can make teenagers feel less lonely and more confident and popular. However, with teens who have a low social-emotional well-being, social media can exacerbate pre-existing problems such as feeling left out or being excluded, as well as feeling bad about themselves when their posts did not get enough likes or comments. In the end, online socializing can make up for the lack of friends IRL (in real life) but it can also make things worse for teens who are already in emotional turmoil. 
 Costco is headquartered in the U.S. and is a large retailer operating warehouse club stores around the world. Canada’s most populous province of Ontario was home to 36 Costco warehouses in Canada as of December 2019, whilst there was just one warehouse in Newfoundland and Labrador. The warehouse club business model Warehouse clubs offer a more limited range of products than a traditional supermarket and aim to attract shoppers who wish to save money by buying in bulk. Shoppers must become a member and pay a fee to be able to shop in Costco’s warehouses. Almost 95 million people worldwide were Costco members in 2018. There are different tiers of membership, all of which enable members to use any Costco warehouse worldwide and online. Other warehouse club retailers with stores in Canada include Sam’s Club and BJ’s wholesale. Brick-and-mortar reigns over e-commerce Costco offers an online shopping service, which can be a convenient and time-saving shopping option; however, the majority of Canadian consumers still spend more on groceries in-store than online. The main reasons preventing consumers from buying groceries online include a lack of interest and shipping and service costs.

 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Swiss franc (EUR CHF), according to data from the European Central Bank, from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until 2019. The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: this denotes concrete values as of specific day (i.e. end of the year). Between the years of 2002 and 2007, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Swiss franc noted an increase. In 2007, the euro to Swiss franc annual average exchange rate was equal to 1.64, which meant that one euro could buy 1.64 Swiss francs. By 2019, this value had decreased overall, to a value of 1.11 which meant that one euro could buy 1.11 Swiss francs. This decrease in average annual euro to Swiss franc exchange rate is reflected in the monthly exchange rate, measured as of end-of-month in recent years.

 This statistic shows the number of U.S. soldier fatalities in the Iraq War in the period between 2003 and 2019. As of June 2019, eight U.S. soldiers died in Iraq. Additional information on fatalities in the Iraq War The invasion of Iraq by the United States and coalition forces in March 2003 saw the beginning of the Iraq War, a conflict that would continue beyond the end of the decade. Fatalities of American forces were highest in the first five years of conflict as soldiers grappled with the Al Qaeda as well as civil war between those groups seeking to fill the power vacuum left by the removal of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Casualties progressively decreased from 2008, in part due to attempts by Barack Obama who made the removal of troops from Iraq a central promise of this successful campaign to succeed George W. Bush. In 2013, the majority of Americans considered sending troops to fight in Iraq to be a mistake. While the number of civilian deaths in the Iraq War was much higher, the trend of numbers decreasing from 2008 onward was in line with the trend for American solider loses. However, civilian deaths rose again from 2013 onward as Iraq returned to heavy conflict with Islamic State. The high number of American fatalities in the first five years of the Iraq War could be seen as influencing the reluctance of the United States to commit ground troop support in the battle against Islamic State when the issue was discussed in 2015. Not only is the loss of life a tragedy in itself, but the political discourse in the United States surrounding the involvement of their troops in Middle Eastern conflicts has made further involvement unattractive to elected officials. However calls for further ground support are likely to continue as Iraq remained the country with the most terrorist attacks as of 2017. 
 The statistic shows the unemployment rate in Switzerland from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, Switzerland's unemployment rate amounted to around 4.87 percent. Switzerland's economy Due to a fairly prosperous and stable economy, Switzerland has essentially become the world’s investment safe haven over the past several decades and one of the globally leading economical leaders. Switzerland primarily thrives due to its services sector, which partially profits from large amounts of tourism, as well as from its manufacturing sector. Due to the country’s low population, Switzerland has simultaneously maintained a low unemployment rate. The majority of employed workers in the country possess a relatively high level of education and are specialized, which essentially allows for the country to offer high end jobs with higher wages, and often guarantees a higher level of productivity and efficiency. As a result, Swiss adults have on average the most amount of money compared to the average amount around the world, beating out countries such as the United States. Despite experiencing the early 2000s recession, 2008 global financial crisis as well as the Eurozone crisis, Switzerland has still sustained a high production of goods and services within the country, being ranked as one of the most efficient and productive countries in the world). Additionally, Swiss households are made up of one of the highest percentages of millionaires in the world, which is made possible by the country’s low tax rates. 
 The statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) in the European Union from 2008 to 2018. GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country within a year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. In 2018, the GDP in the EU amounted to around 15.89 trillion euros. The financial crisis and its aftermath The European Union is a union made up of 28 states located within and around Europe, including several of the world’s largest economies. Since its inception in 1993, the European Union has displayed the benefits of uniting several countries together, however have also showed possible consequences. The majority of European countries felt the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and furthermore the Eurozone crisis, which has had a severe and continuous effect on the general European economy. Additionally, due to the close association between all the countries, several banks around different European countries were forced to shut down. A generally lower standard of life in the EU, particularly around 2009 during the prime of both economical disasters, led to doubt and uncertainty about the future of many European families and consumers. However, as the economic situation all around the world slowly improved, so did the outlook on the future for most consumers. Struggles around Europe resulted in a larger need to stimulate the economy, which was only possible by borrowing and spending more money. As a result, national debt soared. It was also necessary for more economically successful countries to help finance countries that were deep in the crisis, such as Greece.
