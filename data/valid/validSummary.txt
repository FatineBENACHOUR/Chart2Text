Regional imbalances in the medical environment Some experts refute the government 's claims that templateTitle[8] faces a templateYLabel[2] shortage and point towards other factors . For example , templateTitle[8] has a higher population density than other countries , meaning that the average Korean templateYLabel[2] meets with more patients than an Austrian or Norwegian would , for example . Indeed , half the population is concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area and Koreans see templateYLabel[2] over templateTitle[9] times a templateXLabel[0] on average , which is far more frequently than any other OECD nationals . Despite this , templateTitle[8] spends a lower share of its GDP on medical expenditures than other OECD countries , implying that medical personnel templateYLabel[2] more work for less financial compensation . Regional disparities where templateYLabel[2] are concentrated in Seoul and other major cities is also an issue .

The templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[9] has been shaky since the recession of 2008 struck the world economy like a bolt out of the blue and templateTitle[9] is still yet to gain a solid foothold . Despite its ongoing financial predicament however , templateTitle[9] remains one of the world 's most highly developed economies . The economy of templateTitle[9] is the third largest worldwide by nominal templateYLabel[0] and the nation has a very active manufacturing sector .

The UK managed to rise from the state of dark desperation it was in between 2009 and 2010 , from -3.97 to 1.8 percent . The country suffered acutely from the collapse of the banking industry , raising a number of questions within the UK with regards to the country 's heavy reliance on revenues coming from London 's financial sector , arguably the most important in the world and one of the globe 's financial command centers . Since the collapse of the post-war consensus and the rise of Thatcherism , the templateTitle[10] templateTitle[11] has been swept along in a wave of individualism - collective ideals have been abandoned and the mass privatisation of the heavy industries was unveiled - opening them up to market competition and shifting the economic focus to that of service . The Big Bang policy , one of the cornerstones of the Thatcher government programs of reform , involved mass and sudden deregulation of financial markets . This led to huge changes in the way the financial markets in London work , and saw the many old firms being absorbed by big banks . This , one could argue , strengthened the UK financial sector greatly and while frivolous and dangerous practices brought the sector into great disrepute , the city of London alone brings in around one fifth of the countries national income making it a very prominent contributor to wealth in the UK .

More than half of the world 's population templateTitle[0] as feminists - in India alone , over 80 percent of templateYLabel[2] very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists . Surprisingly , this number is much lower in developed countries like the United States or Germany ( with not even 40 percent of templateYLabel[2] agreeing ) , which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully – has . But templateYLabel[0] some really more equal than others ?

While 81 percent of the 18- to 24-year-olds were already online , only twelve percent of those aged 55 years and older were able to access the internet . How are the templateTitle[0] able to improve their accessibility ? Since it is widely recognized that internet access has an impact on economic growth , local authorities must focus on further expanding the templateTitle[5] . There are few promising technologies to do templateTitle[4] templateTitle[1] fiber cables could be installed and even reduce the cost of telecommunication companies in the end . The upcoming 5G templateTitle[5] could help connect remote areas with a trustworthy connection , and if that is too far into the future , satellites could be a viable choice for now ; they are able to reach every point on the earth , making them key for achieving nationwide connectivity .

The Mexican economy is , however , far from trouble-free . And although the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[7] has been increasing , it is showing that it is struggling to match up to the fast pace of growth and prosperity being seen in some of the BRIC countries , as well as the usual suspects of economic success , the United States , Canada and others . Inequality in templateTitle[7] remains a huge problem . The education system in the federation 's thirty-one states is in dire need of reform , and in some of the states , especially in those closest to the US border , brutal criminal drug lords'rule .

However , a strong growth rate does not necessarily lead to all positive outcomes and often has a negative affect on inflation rates . A severe growth in templateYLabel[0] leads to less unemployment , however lower unemployment often leads to higher inflation rates due to demand increasing at a much higher rate than supply and as a result prices rise accordingly . Despite a relatively high templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[0] growth , unemployment only marginally changed over the course of 5 years and is forecasted to remain stagnant going into 2017 . Unemployment , however , is often difficult to predict , primarily now since most economies are still recovering from the 2008 templateTitle[0] financial crisis .
templateTitle[3] 's templateYLabel[2] numbers peaked in templateTitle[4] , when the country experienced its worst recession since World War II .

In templateTitle[6] , the country reported 16.5 templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] 100,000 templateYLabel[5] . What are the reasons behind templateTitle[3] 's high templateYLabel[2] rates ? Historically , templateTitle[3] 's high templateYLabel[2] rates were closely linked to the economic situation of individuals . While the majority of templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[3] stemmed from health reasons , existential worries and problems directly related to work accounted for over 5,000 self-inflicted deaths in templateTitle[6] . The most profound issue faced by employees in templateTitle[3] leading to self-harm was exhaustion . An increasing pressure of retaining jobs by putting in more hours of overtime , while taking fewer holidays and sick days were seen as the main motivators behind the rising templateYLabel[2] numbers among office workers and employees .

So is it likely that the Turkish people are sexually more prolific than everybody else ? Another survey templateTitle[5] another source suggests otherwise : It does not include Turkey when it comes to the countries with the most sexually active inhabitants but lists the Greek as the most active ones . In general , people tend to embellish their own activities , but also those of others – the disparity between the perceived and the actual templateYLabel[1] of times people have templateTitle[2] is staggering and similar everywhere around the templateTitle[4] . India the most monogamous ? Of those countries surveyed , Indian respondents report the lowest templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[3] , only slightly surpassed templateTitle[5] China . Both China and India struggle with a significant difference between the templateYLabel[1] of men and the templateYLabel[1] of women , and both countries largely adhere to conservative standards of sexuality that prohibit templateTitle[2] before marriage .
