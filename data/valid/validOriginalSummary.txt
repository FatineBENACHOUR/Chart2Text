This statistic shows the annual inflation rate in the U.S. from 2010 to 2018 with additional projections up to 2024 . The data represents U.S. city averages . The base period was 1982 - 84 . In economics , the inflation rate is a measurement of inflation , the rate of increase of a price index ( in this case : consumer price index ) .

The monthly inflation rate for the United States can also be accessed here . Inflation in the U.S. Inflation is a term used to describe a general rise in the price of goods and services in an economy over a given period of time . Inflation in the United States is calculated using the consumer price index ( CPI ) . The consumer price index is a measure of change in the price level of a preselected market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households . This forecast of U.S. inflation was prepared by the International Monetary Fund . They project roughly a 2.25 percent annual rise in the general level of prices until 2024 . This means that a product bought today for about 100 U.S. dollars will cost about 102.25 U.S. dollars next year , and so on . Considering the annual inflation rate in the United States in recent years , a 2.25 percent inflation rate is a very moderate projection . Although the moderate inflation of prices between 2 and 3 percent is considered normal in a modern economy , countries ' central banks try to prevent severe inflation and deflation to keep the growth of prices to a minimum . Severe inflation is considered dangerous to a country 's economy because it can rapidly diminish the population 's purchasing power and thus damage the GDP .
This statistic shows the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Italy from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . In 2018 , the GDP in Italy was about 2.08 trillion U.S. dollars . See global GDP for a global comparison . Italy 's economy After increasing significantly year-over-year , Italy 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) has gone through several fluctuations since the global economic crisis in 2008 . The European Union 's third largest economy has experienced downturns , primarily due to inefficiency with regards to spending and incompetent leadership . When analyzing the country 's budget balance , which is essentially the overall difference between revenues and spending , Italy has posted a negative balance , or a state deficit , every year over the past decade . However , their budget balance has improved noticeably every year since 2009 . Since the country spent more than they earned , national debt continued to rise every year , most notably between 2008 and 2009 , and continued to do so going into 2014 . Italy 's dependency on funding from other countries will lead to further debt , unless it finds a way to decrease spending or increase revenues . Despite the country 's ongoing recession , Italy 's GDP ranked the country in the top 10 countries with the largest gross domestic product in 2014 , ahead of economically developed countries such as Canada and Australia . This implies that Italy 's economical struggles are more a result of inefficient spending rather than a lack of production .
