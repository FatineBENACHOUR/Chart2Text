How many people templateYLabel[2] templateTitle[5] ? Having burst onto the scene in 2017 , templateTitle[5] has since become a templateTitle[6] phenomenon , amassing almost 250 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] across the globe as of March templateTitle[7] . How did templateTitle[5] become so big ? The reasons why templateTitle[5] has become such a global hit are clear to see . Not only is the game free , but it is also available on most gaming platforms . On top of this , the Battle Royale-style , in which up to 100 templateYLabel[2] fight it out at one time , mean that the re-playability of the game is infinite – each game is unique . The cartoon style of the game unsurprisingly lends itself more to the younger audience , with almost two-thirds of templateTitle[5] 's templateYLabel[2] aged between 18 and 24 . It also seems that it is not just the casual gamers that are attracted to this game as over templateTitle[7] percent of templateTitle[5] fans admitted to devoting over 16 hours to the game per week . Battle templateTitle[5] Battle Royale supremacy With the rise of games such as templateTitle[5] , the Battle Royale game mode has never been bigger . Revenue in the Battle Royale premium console segment amounted to 2.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 and was estimated to more than double to 6.9 billion U.S. dollars in templateTitle[7] . While templateTitle[5] is certainly staking its claim as the king of the Battle Royale games , it faces stiff competition from PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds which , unlike templateTitle[5] , is available on Steam . PUBG peaked at almost 3.24 templateYLabel[4] concurrent templateYLabel[2] on Steam at the beginning on 2018 and is still regularly peaking at over one templateYLabel[4] concurrent templateYLabel[2] . It seems that game developers are looking to cash in on this ever-growing market , so could new games such as Apex Legends also pose a threat to templateTitle[5] 's supremacy ?

Unemployment within the country , in spite of a slight increase over the past several years , has remained relatively low in comparison many other European countries that were equally as affected by recession .
The statistic depicts templateTitle[9] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[10] . templateYLabel[0] refers to the total market value of all goods and services that templateYLabel[3] produced within a country per templateXLabel[0] . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . Real templateYLabel[0] is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic templateYLabel[1] . In 2018 , templateTitle[9] 's real templateYLabel[0] grew by about 2.26 percent templateYLabel[3] to the templateYLabel[5] templateXLabel[0] . Trade balance of templateTitle[9] With the exception of 2009 , templateTitle[9] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] was relatively stable year-over-year , however at a higher templateYLabel[2] prior to the financial crisis .

However , templateTitle[9] primarily profited from exporting goods , earning the majority of its revenues from its trade balance of goods , while the nation posted a trade deficit on its services , its highest loss recorded since 2003 . templateTitle[9] imports and exports its products and services primarily to neighboring countries or countries in Europe . templateTitle[9] 's most important trade partner is arguably China , potentially due to shared borders and strong political relations between the two nations . China is accountable for roughly 19.2 percent of all of templateTitle[9] 's imports , however only makes up roughly 8.3 percent of the country 's total exports . China has become an important import partner for many nations around the world as well as a country where larger companies can manufacture goods at a cheaper price .
What is the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of residential property in the templateTitle[7] ? In the fourth quarter of templateTitle[8] , a templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] cost approximately 344,000 templateYLabel[3] . There were large differences between the Dutch provinces , however . templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] were most expensive in the central templateTitle[11] of Utrecht with an templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of 454,000 templateYLabel[3] , whereas a similar house in Groningen had an templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] tag of 225,000 templateYLabel[3] . Overall , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] a private individual would pay when buying any type of existing residential property ( such as templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] but also , for example , an apartment ) was approximately 287,000 templateYLabel[3] in 2018 .

This is an effect of past developments : the templateYLabel[1] to rent ratio ( the nominal purchase templateYLabel[1] of a house divided templateTitle[10] the annual rent of a similar place ) shows that for a long time it was relatively cheaper to buy a property in the templateTitle[7] than to rent one . Life for rent : mortgages in the templateTitle[7] Additionally , the templateTitle[7] has one of the highest mortgage debts among private individuals in Europe . In 2018 , total debt reached a value of approximately 714 billion templateYLabel[3] . This has a political background as the Dutch tax system allowed homeowners for many years to deduct interest paid on mortgage from pre-tax income for a maximum period of thirty years , essentially allowing for income support for homeowners . In the templateTitle[7] , this system is known as hypotheekrenteaftrek . Note that since 2014 , the Dutch government is slowly scaling this down with a planned acceleration from 2020 onwards .
The statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[4] .

Even though deflation only occurred for one templateXLabel[0] in 2009 and the price level has been increasing since , templateTitle[3] 's economy still has a long way to go until full recovery . Apart from the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] and the unemployment templateYLabel[1] , gross domestic product / GDP growth in templateTitle[3] and the trade balance of goods in templateTitle[3] , i.e . the exports of goods minus the imports , templateYLabel[2] additional indicators of templateTitle[3] 's desolate condition during the economic crisis and its slow and difficult recovery ever since .

In 2018 , templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] global templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] amounted to about 500.34 templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] dollars.WalmartWal-Mart was founded in 1962 by Sam Walton when he and his brother James `` Bud '' Walton opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in Rogers , Arkansas . Since then , Wal-Mart has grown to become the largest publicly-owned retail company in the templateTitle[4] . In the United States , the company includes Wal-Mart discount stores , Supercenters , Neighborhood Markets , and Sam templateTitle[1] Club warehouse membership clubs . The company also has many international operations . Wal-Mart is considered a variety store which focuses on low prices featuring apparel as well as hard goods , and has been committed to upholding their basic value of customer service.Beginning in the early 1990s , Wal-Mart went to great lengths to increase their market share .

Even though Wal-Mart has been criticized for their low wages , they claim to templateYLabel[2] a lot of good for lower income households . Figures show that a family can save about one thousand templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] a templateXLabel[1] with their ability to cut prices on some products , such as toys , by thirty percent in order to stimulate more templateTitle[3] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[2] in the United States templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] to templateTitle[9] . In templateTitle[9] , the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] ( aged six years and older ) in templateTitle[2] amounted to approximately 15.64 templateYLabel[4] .
As of templateTitle[7] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of templateTitle[4] was 40.5 thousand templateYLabel[4] per templateXLabel[0] , a growth of just over 5.8 thousand templateYLabel[4] when compared with templateTitle[5] . From templateTitle[5] until 2007 , templateYLabel[2] rose by less than a thousand templateYLabel[4] , with templateYLabel[2] growth accelerating mainly in the period after 2010 . The 607 templateYLabel[4] increase recorded between 2010 and 2011 was the largest templateYLabel[2] rise seen during this period . Comparisons with rest of the templateYLabel[4] Within the European Union Luxembourg had an templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] salary of over 71 thousand U.S dollars , with templateTitle[4] having an templateYLabel[1] salary comparable to other large European Countries , such as the United Kingdom and France . In neighboring Poland , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] salary was just over 13 thousand U.S dollars , meaning that templateTitle[4] 's earned , on templateYLabel[0] , more than three times what their Polish counterparts did . templateTitle[4] economy slowing in 2019 While templateTitle[4] initially had one of the strongest recoveries from the 2008 financial crash and as of templateTitle[7] had the largest economy in Europe its economy has started to slow in recent years . For 2019 the templateTitle[4] economy is forecasted to grow at a rate of only 0.75 percent , compared with 2.46 percent in 2017 . Although the economic outlook is set to improve slightly in 2020 , it remains to be seen if the low levels of growth predicted in the coming years will have an impact on templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[2] .
The statistic shows the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[9] from 1984 to 2017 , with projections up until templateTitle[10] . In 2017 , the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[9] was around 38,342.74 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . For further information , see templateTitle[9] 's templateYLabel[0] . templateTitle[9] 's economy templateTitle[9] is the world 's second largest developed economy and a member of the Group of Eight , also known as G8 , which is comprised of the eight leading industrialized countries . Due to a weak financial sector , overregulation and a lack of demand , templateTitle[9] suffered substantially from the early 1990s until 2000 , a time referred to as ‘ 'The Lost Decade ' _ ' . templateTitle[9] 's economy is still slowly recovering from the country 's asset price bubble collapse ; however it continues to struggle to retain economic milestones achieved in the 1980s . templateTitle[9] 's response to the crash was to stimulate the economy , which in turn resulted in extensive amounts of debt that further increased into the 21st century , most notably after the 2008 financial crisis . Despite maintaining a surprisingly low unemployment rate , demand within the country remains inadequate , primarily because Japanese residents spend a rather small fraction of the money they earned from the workplace . Lower demand often has a direct effect on production , with companies seeing not enough profits to continue production at such a high rate . Based on the consumer confidence index , Japanese households found that their quality of life , income growth , employment and propensity to durable goods was below satisfactory standards , perhaps due to these households still experiencing the effects of the 1990s bubble crash .
templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[0] reached an all-time high as of templateTitle[6] , when templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] auto industry sold some 21 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . This figure is almost double the templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[1] , when just 11.77 templateYLabel[3] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[4] were sold in templateTitle[0] . templateTitle[2] industry in templateTitle[0] In templateTitle[6] , templateTitle[2] vehicles also made up the majority of vehicles in production in templateTitle[0] , followed by passenger vehicles . There are many kinds of templateTitle[2] vehicles available in templateTitle[0] , including scooters , motorcycles , and mopeds . As of 2018 , the leading templateTitle[2] manufacturer in templateTitle[0] was Hero MotoCorp . The manufacturer of the highly sought-after Splendor motorcycle model is headquartered in templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] capital New Delhi . Major automotive brands in IndiaMotor templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[0] have doubled between 2008 and 2018 . Among passenger cars , Maruti Suzuki , followed by Hyundai Motor of templateTitle[0] , holds a majority of the market . templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] best-selling cars in 2018 included models such as Alto , Swift Dzire and Baleno , to name a few .
Canadians aged between 25 and 34 had the highest rate of templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] nationally as of December templateTitle[10] . Some 26.9 percent of survey templateYLabel[2] in this templateTitle[9] group stated that they consumed templateTitle[5] of any form in the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] . Those aged 65 or older had the lowest levels of templateTitle[6] , with just 6.1 percent of templateYLabel[2] consuming templateTitle[5] in this time . templateTitle[9] related opinions on legalization templateTitle[7] became only the second country worldwide to legalize the use of templateTitle[3] for recreational purposes in all provinces in October 2018 . Unsurprisingly , most Canadians who approved of this legalization when surveyed in October 2018 , were aged between 18 and 34 . The highest rates of disapproval came from those aged 65 or over . Canadians aged 18 to 34 have also been the most active in the post-legalization templateTitle[5] market . For example , around 25 percent of this templateTitle[9] group had visited a website that sells templateTitle[5] online and 17 percent had used templateTitle[5] in October 2018 .
The statistic depicts the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] as of June templateTitle[8] . That year , e-commerce company Amazon 's templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] was 888 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . Alphabet , the parent company of search templateYLabel[0] leader Google , had a templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of 741 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . The end of the 1990 in the United States saw the rise of a great number of templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] , also called online templateTitle[6] or a variety of the name `` dot templateTitle[6] , '' where the `` .com '' domain is derived from the word commercial . At the time , such startups were merely riding the wave of early templateTitle[5] business , but had little capital and perhaps one good idea . Few templateTitle[6] have survived the burst of the dot templateTitle[6] bubble and even fewer have managed to become internationally successful . A few notable exceptions are American templateTitle[6] such as Google ( founded in 1998 ) , Amazon ( founded in 1994 ) or eBay Inc. ( founded in 1995 ) , and the Chinese online giant Alibaba ( founded in 1998 ) , which have come to be some of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] in the templateTitle[7] . Topping the ranking of templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] is currently Alphabet , the parent company of Google , with a templateYLabel[0] capitalization of 741 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] as of June templateTitle[8] . Having started as a PhD project at Stanford University , the Google project slowly gained traction and is now the number one search engine in the templateTitle[7] , with a templateYLabel[0] share of 90 percent on the search engine templateYLabel[0] . Due to a number of high profile acquisitions , Google has expanded its portfolio beyond search , to include the video content sharing site YouTube , the digital app templateXLabel[0] Google Play Store , the webmail service Gmail and the web browser Google Chrome , to only name a few . As of March templateTitle[8] , it is also the most visited multi-platform website in the United States , with almost 256 million templateYLabel[4] unique visitors during that month alone . In October 2015 , Google reorganized itself into a newly created parent company , the multinational conglomerate Alphabet Inc . The biggest templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] in terms of their workforce are currently Amazon , Google and eBay .
The statistic depicts the total templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] in the United States from templateTitle[6] to templateTitle[8] . The total templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] in the templateYLabel[4] amounted to approximately 15.4 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] in templateTitle[8] . templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] – additional information The amount of templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the United States has decreased since 2008 making it appear that Americans are trying to reduce their templateYLabel[1] and stock up on savings as a result of the economic crisis . While this may be true , decreases in templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] can be mainly attributed to decreases in templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] on family residences and not all of this templateYLabel[1] reduction has come willingly . High numbers of housing unit foreclosures have likely reduced templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] overall , in addition to templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] restructuring and short-sales . The result of which would have had a great impact on templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] overall , given the fact that household templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] composes by far the largest share of household templateYLabel[1] ) and because the total value of templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the United States is around 10 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . However , it is not only templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] that has contributed to this decrease , but also nonfarm and non-residential property has probably made a significant impact as well . In contrast , mortgages on multifamily residences and farm properties increase from templateXLabel[0] to templateXLabel[0] . Their value , however , is much smaller than the one of the previously mentioned debts and as such does n't have a big impact on the total value of templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the templateYLabel[4] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[1] of the real templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) in templateTitle[8] from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[9] . The real templateYLabel[0] is also known as economic templateYLabel[1] . In 2018 , the templateYLabel[1] of the real templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[8] was at approximately 2.83 percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[4] templateXLabel[0] . templateTitle[8] 's economy Based on economic standards , templateTitle[8] is recognized as an emerging market and is one of the world 's newly industrialized countries , having earned a place in the Group of Twenty , which is a group consisting of the twenty most important economies in the world . templateTitle[8] 's economical significance is partially attributed to the country 's templateYLabel[1] , especially during the recent global financial recession . While countries around the world struggled to templateYLabel[1] , let alone maintain a balanced economy , templateTitle[8] experienced a rather high percentage of templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[1] annually . Additionally , templateTitle[8] 's financial sector saw significant improvements , most notably with the country 's inflation , which reached rates lower than those prior to the financial crash and even the lowest in a decade . With a rapidly growing populace as well as having had one of the fastest growing economies in Europe and the world , templateTitle[8] managed to maintain a stable and unchanged unemployment rate over the past decade , with the exception of 2009 . However , despite a significant spike in unemployment , templateTitle[8] 's competent management helped bring the total unemployment rate to single digits for the first time in many years .

This was the highest templateTitle[1] during this period . templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] were at their lowest in the first half of templateTitle[6] at 26.7 templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] . Danish templateTitle[3] spent the most templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] of templateTitle[0] throughout Europe in 2018 , with templateTitle[1] slightly more expensive than in Germany . Energy taxes highest in Copenhagen One of the reasons templateTitle[2] the high templateTitle[1] of templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[5] is that taxes account templateTitle[2] a large proportion of the overall templateTitle[1] . As of January templateTitle[8] , energy taxes made up a share of approximately 16 percent of the average templateYLabel[0] residential end-user templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] structure . In the Danish capital Copenhagen , however , energy taxes amounted to 41 percent . This was by far the highest energy taxation in major European cities . High quality templateTitle[0] supply Whilst templateTitle[3] in templateTitle[5] pay some of the highest templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] around , the templateTitle[0] supply is ranked as one of the best in the world with an index score of 6.8 out of a possible 7 . Only Scandinavian neighbor Norway , Singapore and Switzerland had a higher ranking than templateTitle[5] in 2018 .
This timeline shows templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] to templateTitle[10] . In templateTitle[10] , templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] amounted to about 21.92 billion templateYLabel[3] . templateTitle[1] The templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] is the largest sporting goods manufacturer across Europe and the second largest templateTitle[6] – only behind long-term competitor Nike . The company manufactures sports clothing as well as other products such as bags , shirts , watches , eyewear , and other sports- and clothing-related goods .

Between January templateTitle[12] and December templateTitle[14] , the lowest templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[0] raindays occurred in September templateTitle[12] , when just 5 templateYLabel[2] recorded 1mm or more of templateTitle[3] . The highest templateYLabel[0] of raindays was recorded in January of the same year , at 23.4 . Fourth quarter the wettest The wettest periods of the year tend to be the start and the end . In 2018 , the fourth quarter was the wettest , with an average of 452 mm of rainfall . November and December of the same year recorded the highest levels of templateTitle[0] rainfall after January , at 122.6 and 119.5 mm respectively . Regional weather Due to the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] 's geographical location and landscape , weather conditions can vary greatly . Scotland has on average been the wettest country since 2010 . The majority of rainfall is concentrated in the Scottish Highlands , as precipitation often occurs in mountainous regions . As rainfall comes in from the Atlantic , it is the northern and western parts of the templateTitle[10] that are most susceptible to precipitation . This explains why England is the driest of all the regions , as templateTitle[3] deposits reduce as they move east .
The templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] of the templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] of templateTitle[4] ( NAR ) has steadily increased since 2012 , reaching a membership of 1.4 templateYLabel[4] in templateTitle[11] , an all-time high . This trend also reflects the recovery of the property market after the financial crisis of 2007 templateTitle[10] templateTitle[9] , as the volume of home sales began to climb from 2011 . The NAR is a North American trade templateTitle[2] for templateTitle[4] estate workers formed in 1908 and currently based in Chicago , Illinois . Employment in the templateTitle[4] estate sector The upward in NRA membership is mirrored in overall employment in the templateTitle[4] estate sector in the United States .

Employment in the sector is set to increase in firms with less than 2,500 employees until 2026 . Larger firms – those with 2,500 employees or more – are forecast to decrease the templateYLabel[0] of employees in the near future . Membership growth ties in with growth in home sales The growth in NAR membership also correlates with the growth of residential property sales . For instance , the templateYLabel[0] of new houses sold in the templateTitle[0] has been on the rise since 2011 . American adults as a whole have been steady in their view that home ownership is an important part of the American Dream . However , the share of American Millennials – those born between 1981 and 1996 templateTitle[10] who view homeownership as important has been fluctuating since 2010 . This adds an element of uncertainty to the future of the housing market , because Millennials are in their mid-twenties and thirties , which is widely viewed as the best time to buy a home from a home equity perspective .

As of the first quarter of 2019 , templateTitle[4] has generated 2.6 billion U.S. dollars of advertising revenue in that region .
The templateYLabel[3] , followed templateTitle[6] Switzerland , had the highest templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] to stay in a templateTitle[3] as of templateTitle[8] . At that time the templateTitle[3] costs templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] in the templateYLabel[3] were on templateYLabel[0] 5,220 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . In comparison , the templateTitle[3] costs templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] in Spain stood at an templateYLabel[0] of 424 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . Even Switzerland , also a very expensive templateXLabel[0] , had significantly lower costs than the United States . Number of templateYLabel[3] hospitalsThe number of templateYLabel[3] hospitals has decreased in recent years with some increase in 2017 . There are several types of hospitals in the templateYLabel[3] with different ownerships .

Between templateTitle[11] to templateTitle[13] , templateTitle[7] in the templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] in the United Kingdom ( templateTitle[0] ) has fallen . In templateTitle[13] , the templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] of people employed in this templateTitle[2] in the templateTitle[0] amounted to approximately 1.1 templateYLabel[4] . This was a decrease compared to pre-global recession figures , when on the British market there were 1.2 templateYLabel[4] people were employed in all subsectors of templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] . These figures have decreased as a result of the crisis and closer of bank branches across the country , to approximately 1.1 templateYLabel[4] in 2010 , but since then they noted a rocky few years fluctuating between nearly 1.15 and 1.1 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] . templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] The trend for the templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[2] in the United Kingdom can be seen in contrast to estimations for London , as one of the leading centers of international finance . Overall the templateYLabel[0] of finance and insurance templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[2] in London is forecast to grow over the coming years . templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] , which include banks , credit unions , credit-card companies , accountancy firms , insurance companies as well as templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] companies are an integral part of any economy . The banking templateTitle[2] assets as percentage of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was approximately 380 percent in 2018 .
The statistic shows the degree of templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] from 2008 to templateTitle[3] and details the percentage of the entire templateYLabel[3] , living in templateYLabel[2] areas . In templateTitle[3] , 81.41 percent of the total templateYLabel[3] in templateTitle[2] lived in cities . templateTitle[2] 's rural exodus templateTitle[2] is one of the largest countries in the world regarding land area , second behind Russia . However , Canada´s inhabitants - like the majority of people around the world - prefer to live in cities where there templateYLabel[0] more possibilities to work and play . The country is part of North America , the most urbanized continent in the world . In 2014 , almost 82 percent of templateTitle[2] was urbanized , i.e . more than 80 percent of the Canadian templateYLabel[3] lived in cities . The manufacturing , finance , construction and trade that occurs within their boundaries help fuel the economy of templateYLabel[2] areas . While mining and oil and gas extraction compose a large templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[2] 's GDP and templateYLabel[0] often located in rural areas , they do not provide many jobs . Furthermore , agriculture , which was once of primary importance to the economy of rural areas , no longer plays the same role and makes up only a small templateYLabel[0] of both GDP and employment . In templateTitle[2] , people primarily migrate to the larger cities such as Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As these cities and others attract young adults , this leaves less of them who stay and start families in rural areas . As a consequence , rural areas templateYLabel[0] experiencing a templateYLabel[3] decline as rural births do not compensate for templateYLabel[2] migration . Shrinking rural areas and growing templateYLabel[2] areas will place demands on both templateYLabel[2] and rural infrastructure in templateTitle[2] and around the world .

It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . Real templateYLabel[0] is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic templateYLabel[1] . In 2018 , templateTitle[9] 's real templateYLabel[0] increased by about 0.86 percent templateYLabel[3] to the templateYLabel[5] templateXLabel[0] . templateTitle[9] 's national debt templateTitle[9] 's economy is a developed industrial economy that ranks as one of the largest in the world . A large and efficient economy has helped templateTitle[9] attain a spot as a member of the G7 and G8 , as well as the European Union . After the Second World War , templateTitle[9] experienced a significant economic boost due to support from the ‘ 'Free World ' _ ' , which is a term used to identify non-communist countries during the Cold War . But several decades of economic templateYLabel[1] came to an end after the 2008 recession ; from roughly 2007 to 2011 , the Italian 's encountered multiple setbacks that shrunk the national economy and dramatically affected the country as a whole . Debt became a major problem and templateTitle[9] saw annual national debt templateYLabel[1] primarily due to the country 's inability to maintain its budget properly as well as an overall decrease in templateYLabel[0] . As a result , investors often questioned the country 's ability to pay off its debts without incurring further debt , particularly due to the country 's large debt-to-GDP ratio , which remains one of the highest in the world .

With a land mass of less than half that of the United States and a templateTitle[1] almost four times greater , templateTitle[3] has recognized potential problems of its growing templateTitle[1] . Government attempts to implement family planning programs have achieved varying degrees of success . Initiatives such as sterilization programs in the 1970s have been blamed for creating general antipathy to family planning , but the combined efforts of various family planning and contraception programs have helped halve fertility rates since the 1960s . The templateTitle[1] growth rate has correspondingly shrunk as well , but has not yet reached less than one percent growth per templateXLabel[0] . As home to thousands of ethnic groups , hundreds of languages , and numerous religions , a cohesive and broadly-supported effort to reduce templateTitle[1] growth is difficult to create . Despite that , templateTitle[3] is one country to watch in coming years .

A full treatment including templateTitle[6] extensions is significantly more expensive than a soft templateTitle[3] polish . templateTitle[3] versus acrylic The main alternative to gel-based templateTitle[6] treatments is acrylic treatments . templateTitle[3] treatments are a relatively new invention compared to acrylic templateTitle[6] treatments , emerging in the 1980 's . Many people prefer templateTitle[3] templateTitle[6] treatments , claiming they have a more natural feeling while providing a longer-lasting , glossier finish with no chipping , peeling or cracking . However , templateTitle[3] templateTitle[6] are more complicated to apply than acrylic treatments , making acrylic templateTitle[4] and full sets cheaper than their templateTitle[3] alternatives . In addition , gels are more difficult to remove , meaning that removal often creates an additional cost – although it is possible to remove templateTitle[3] treatments at home .

Even in a healthy economy templateYLabel[0] occurs . If former employed persons go back to school or leave the job to take care of children they are no longer part of the active labor force and therefore not among the unemployed . templateYLabel[0] can also be the effect of events that are not part of the normal dynamics of an economy . Layoffs can be the result of technological progress , for example when robots replace workers in automobile production . Sometimes templateYLabel[0] is caused by job outsourcing , due to the fact that employers often search for cheap labor around the globe and not only domestically .

For 2019 , the number of templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] is estimated to reach 26.6 templateYLabel[3] . templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] – additional information Smartphones are mobile phones that have more advanced computing capabilities and connectivity than regular mobile phones . Starting with the introduction of the Apple iPhone in 2007 , smartphones have risen in popularity . In 2007 , around 120 templateYLabel[3] smartphones were sold worldwide . By 2014 , this figure had already passed 1.2 billion . Over a third of the world 's population is projected to own a templateYLabel[0] by 2017.The number of templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] worldwide is expected to reach 2.56 billion by 2018 . In templateTitle[3] , the templateYLabel[0] market is an important segment of the telecommunication industry , given that the country is amongst the leaders in regards to the share of mobile templateYLabel[0] subscribers who templateYLabel[1] smartphones . The templateYLabel[0] penetration rate is expected to increase in the next few years , and reach about 65 percent of mobile templateYLabel[1] by 2017 . Apart from the basic features of smartphones such as making templateYLabel[0] calls and sending text messages , Canadians templateYLabel[1] their smartphones for a range of activities . They templateYLabel[1] their devices primarily to take photos and videos , check the time and weather . Canadians also check emails , search the web and visit social networks on their smartphones on a weekly basis . When they are on the go , many Canadian templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] look up directions or search for a new restaurant on their mobile devices .
The templateTitle[1] in templateTitle[3] grew to 32.4 templateYLabel[2] people in 2018 . This is in line with a steady positive trend that has been happening since at least 2014 and is forecast to continue until at least templateTitle[4] , as well as with the growth rates in other ASEAN countries . Malaysian demographics As the fertility rate slowly declines , the templateTitle[1] growth rate should slowly decline as well . However , since life expectancy is also slowly increasing , this can still fuel templateTitle[1] growth , as we see in this statistic . In templateTitle[3] , this is leading to a healthy age structure , with a large group of working-age people who are able to support a smaller number of old and young people . Economic effects A growing templateTitle[1] should lead to an increasing gross domestic product ( GDP ) , simply because more people means more consumers and workers . This is especially effective if the country is at full employment . Given the generally low level of unemployment in templateTitle[3] , it is fairly safe to assume that this is true .
While the standard image of the nuclear family with two parents and 2.5 children has persisted in the American imagination , the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] in the U.S. has steadily been decreasing since templateTitle[7] , with about 3.79 templateYLabel[4] babies born in templateTitle[9] . In templateTitle[7] , this figure was 4.16 templateYLabel[4] . templateYLabel[2] and replacement rates A country 's templateYLabel[2] rate is defined as the templateYLabel[0] of live templateYLabel[2] per 1,000 inhabitants , and it is this particularly important templateYLabel[0] that has been decreasing over the past few decades . The declining templateYLabel[2] rate is not solely an American problem , with EU member templateTitle[6] showing comparable rates to the U.S. Additionally , each country has what is called a `` replacement rate . '' The replacement rate is the rate of fertility needed to keep a population stable when compared with the death rate . In the U.S. , the fertility rate needed to keep the population stable is around 2.1 children per woman , but this figure was at 1.77 in 2017 . Falling templateYLabel[2] rates Currently , there is much discussion as to what exactly is causing the templateYLabel[2] rate to decrease in the templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] . There seem to be several factors in play , including longer life expectancies , financial concerns ( such as the economic crisis of 2008 ) , and an increased focus on careers , all of which are causing people to wait longer to start a family . How international governments will handle falling populations remains to be seen , but what is clear is that the declining templateYLabel[2] rate is a multifaceted problem without an easy solution .
The statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] with consultative status with ECOSOC from 1948 to templateTitle[6] . In templateTitle[6] , 3382 global organizations had consultative status with ECOSOC . Non-governmental organizations As shown in the statistic above , the templateYLabel[0] of non-governmental organizations , also known as templateYLabel[2] , has significantly increased over the last decades . Non-governmental organizations are usually set templateTitle[4] by foundations or private persons and the organizations are neither part of the government nor a profit business . One characteristic is the charitable orientation of the non-governmental organizations . The largest non-government donator in templateXLabel[0] 2009 , which was the templateTitle[3] Food Programme ( WFP ) , donated around 2.15 million Euros , while the second largest non-governmental organization , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , provided aid and relief to the value of templateTitle[6] million Euros in templateXLabel[0] 2009 .

In that templateXLabel[0] , Pakistan received about 1.4 billion U.S. dollars , according to the data of the Global Humanitarian Assistance . Afghanistan was on rank 4 and received about 771 million U.S. dollars worth of aid the same templateXLabel[0] . A survey among Afghans concerning the misappropriation of foreign aid in Afghanistan , which was held by the Afghan Center for Socio-Economic and Opinion Research in December templateTitle[6] , found out that 67 percent of the respondents thought that a lot of foreign aid was being embezzled , while 27 percent of the participants thought that only a little of the foreign aid was being embezzled .
templateTitle[3] 's templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] was 9.31 percent in templateTitle[4] . This represents a steady decline from the increase after the financial crisis , but pre-recession levels were still above 10 percent . What is templateYLabel[0] ? The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of a country refers to the share of people who want to work but can not find jobs . This includes workers who have lost jobs and are searching for new ones , workers whose jobs ended due to an economic downturn , and workers for whom there are no jobs because the labor supply in their industry is larger than the number of jobs available . Different statistics suggest which factors contribute to the overall templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] . The Kenyan context The first type , so-called `` search templateYLabel[0] '' , is hardest to see in the data . The closest proxy is templateTitle[3] 's inflation templateYLabel[1] . As workers take new jobs faster , employers are forced to increase wages , leading to higher templateYLabel[0] . Jobs lost due to economic downturns , called `` cyclical templateYLabel[0] '' , can be seen by decreases in the GDP growth templateYLabel[1] , which are not significant in templateTitle[3] . Finally , `` structural templateYLabel[0] '' refers to workers changing the industry , or even economic sector , in which they are working . In templateTitle[3] , more and more workers switch to the services sector . This is often a result of urbanization , but any structural shift in the economy 's composition can lead to this templateYLabel[0] .
This statistic gives information on the templateTitle[3] of templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of the chat-app templateTitle[0] . As of the beginning of templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] , the Japanese chat templateTitle[1] had 560 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] worldwide , up from 400 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] in April templateTitle[10] . templateTitle[0] and templateTitle[0] Game templateTitle[0] is a global chat templateTitle[1] developed for Android and iOS smartphones which has since expanded to other mobile platforms and a desktop client . Originally created during the aftermath of the Tōhoku earthquake in March 2011 , templateTitle[0] was initially developed as an internet-based communication platform that could function without the then-damaged telecommunications infrastructure in Japan . templateTitle[0] supports text and multimedia messaging and revealed a daily message volume of 10 billion messages in early April templateTitle[10] . templateYLabel[2] can also send photos , purchase stickers similar to emoji and make free voice calls similar to Skype . templateTitle[0] 's free messaging service proved a popular alternative to text-messaging and the templateTitle[1] reached 100 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] within 18 months of its release . Aside from the instant messaging features , templateTitle[0] has also integrated social networking elements such as templateYLabel[2] profiles as well as a personal timeline that allows templateYLabel[2] to share personal status messages with contacts in real-time . Despite being devised as a mobile messenger , templateTitle[0] has successfully transformed into a social templateTitle[1] platform with a strong social gaming presence . Since launching in July 2012 , the chat templateTitle[1] 's gaming platform templateTitle[0] Game has passed 300 templateYLabel[4] downloads . To access templateTitle[0] Game content , templateYLabel[2] need a templateTitle[0] account . The games feature strong social components as well as in-app purchases and thus strongly contribute to the company 's revenue stream .
The global templateTitle[2] market experienced some fairly turbulent times between templateTitle[5] and 2010 , seeing templateYLabel[1] rates as high as 11.3 percent as well as lows reaching -9.5 percent during that time period . However , since 2011 the situation has stabilized , and templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[1] remained on average at roughly five percent . According to projections , in templateTitle[7] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] will have grown by 4.5 percent . Global templateTitle[2] in 2021 Not surprisingly , the internet will be the largest templateTitle[2] medium in templateTitle[7] , accounting for a little over half of global templateTitle[2] expenditures that templateXLabel[0] . Television , which has been the undisputed favorite among advertisers , will be overtaken by digital media . Between 2018 and 2021 TV is forecast to lose close to 4.3 billion U.S. dollars , while mobile internet is expected to gain 90 billion dollars in the same period . Half of major media , except for mobile internet , cinema , outdoor and radio are projected to lose investments in those three years . All in all , North America will still be the most prominent region , with the U.S. poised to hold the crown for the largest templateTitle[2] market in 2021 . Canada and Mexico will take the second and third spots within the region , but on a global scale are not predicted to rank anywhere close to the top three markets . As a matter of fact , Asian countries , China and Japan will close the top three , making Asia the second leading region in terms of templateTitle[2] expenditures .

The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of a templateTitle[4] is an index that divides the templateTitle[4] into two equal groups : half of the templateTitle[4] is older than the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] and the other half younger . In templateTitle[9] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] 's templateTitle[4] was 40 templateYLabel[3] . templateTitle[4] of the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] The templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] ( UK ) includes Great Britain ( England , Scotland and Wales ) and Northern Ireland , and is a state located off the coast of continental Europe . The templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] is a constitutional monarchy , which means the Queen acts as representative head of state , while laws and constitutional issues are discussed and passed by a parliament . The total UK templateTitle[4] figures have been steadily increasing , albeit only slightly , over the last decade ; in 2011 , the templateTitle[4] growth rate was lower than in the previous templateXLabel[0] for the first time in eight templateYLabel[3] . Like many other countries , the UK and its economy were severely affected by the economic crisis in 2009 . Since then , the unemployment rate has doubled and is only recovering slowly . UK inhabitants tend to move to the cities to find work and better living conditions ; urbanization in the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] has been on the rise . At the same time , templateTitle[4] density in the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] has been increasing due to several factors , for example , the rising number of inhabitants and their life expectancy at birth , an increasing fertility rate , and a very low number of emigrants . In fact , the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] is now among the templateTitle[9] countries with the highest life expectancy at birth worldwide . As can be seen above , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of UK residents has also been increasing significantly since the seventies ; another indicator for a well-working economy and society .

With the exception of 2009 templateTitle[10] which the annual percentage change to templateTitle[4] shows as a decrease templateTitle[10] there was an increase in the templateYLabel[2] every templateXLabel[0] . The templateTitle[8] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of services shows that there was also steady growth throughout this period , although this trend was not mirrored by the templateTitle[8] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of goods whereby there was some initial fluctuation which was then followed by substantial annual increases . Fluctuation can also be found in monthly templateTitle[4] , whereby templateTitle[4] experienced a decline in each January , before gradually increasing throughout the remainder of the templateXLabel[0] . A very similar trend is found in the monthly templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] Jevons ( RPIJ ) . In addition , an templateTitle[4] inflation forecast is also accessible .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] in templateTitle[6] from 1950 to 2050 . The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is the templateYLabel[1] that divides a templateTitle[4] into two numerically equal groups ; that is , half the people are younger than this templateYLabel[1] and half are older .

When Russia seized and annexed Crimea in March of 2014 , pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was also ousted and the economy of templateTitle[3] took a hard hit . This resulted in sharp reductions in templateTitle[3] 's GDP , and likely caused a sharp increase in templateTitle[0] as well . Before the turmoil , Russia was templateTitle[3] 's most important import and export partner , having a significant impact on GDP after tension arose . Meanwhile , templateTitle[3] was and still is getting itself out of economic despair ; templateTitle[3] has amassed more debt with the IMF than Greece and is trying to reduce this debt by implementing hyper-austerity , which involves making cuts to public spending .

There are fewer templateTitle[2] mines in operation , and the price of templateTitle[2] has fallen , making the production and consumption of templateTitle[2] a less attractive prospect than it used to be . Each of these factors has lead to the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[4] contracting , and the loss of templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] jobs . With the exception of South and Central America , and the Asia Pacific region , most regions around the world saw a drop in templateTitle[2] consumption .

The templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] of the templateTitle[8] templateTitle[9] is beginning to show signs of recovery since seeing a sharp decline in the wake of the financial crisis . The decreasing unemployment rate in the templateTitle[8] templateTitle[9] is also indicating that the worst could be over for the country . However , some concerns have arisen about what forms of employment are being represented , how stable the jobs are , and whether or not they are simply being cited by officials in government as validation for reforms that are criticized by opponents as being ‘ ideologically motivated ' _ .

While templateTitle[2] 's templateTitle[0] rates templateYLabel[0] still low compared to other developed nations - which can reach levels of 80 - 90 percent - , this transformation in templateTitle[2] is still significant , especially as most of this growth occurs and is expected to occur in the Krung Thep area , better known as Bangkok , capital and largest city in templateTitle[2] . Krung Thep is now home to more than 5.7 million people . The number of tourists and overnight visitors to the city is also on the rise : In 2015 alone , the city had more than templateTitle[3] million visitors . This development will place increasing demands on templateYLabel[2] infrastructure , as the city grows and grows . The second largest city in templateTitle[2] is Nonthaburi , but it only has around one quarter of a million inhabitants , a significant difference . Despite the country 's rural but shifting templateYLabel[3] , templateTitle[2] 's fertility rate is low and below the natural replacement rate , and templateYLabel[3] growth in general is thus only minimal .

In templateTitle[3] , 77.31 percent of templateTitle[2] 's templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[3] lived in templateYLabel[2] areas and cities . templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] Currently , about three quarter of the templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[3] live in templateYLabel[2] areas and cities , which is more than in most nations around the world . templateTitle[0] , as it can be seen in this graph , refers to the number of people living in an templateYLabel[2] area and has nothing to do with the actual geographical size or footprint of an area or country . A country which is significantly bigger than templateTitle[2] could have a similar degree of templateTitle[0] , just because not all areas in the country templateYLabel[0] inhabitable , for example . One example for this is Russia , where templateTitle[0] has reached comparable figures to templateTitle[2] , even though its geographical size is significantly bigger . However , templateTitle[2] 's level of templateTitle[0] does not make the list of the top 30 most urbanized nations in the world , where templateTitle[0] rates templateYLabel[0] higher than 83 percent . Also , while 25 percent of the templateYLabel[3] in templateTitle[2] still lives in rural areas , rural livelihoods templateYLabel[0] not dependent on agriculture , as only 0.75 percent of GDP came from the agricultural sector in 2014 . So while templateTitle[2] 's templateTitle[0] rate is growing , a significant percentage of the templateYLabel[3] is still living in rural areas . Furthermore , templateTitle[2] has a number of shrinking cities which templateYLabel[0] located to the east and in older industrial regions around the country . Considering that templateYLabel[3] growth in templateTitle[2] is on the decline , because of low fertility rates , and that a number of cities templateYLabel[0] shrinking , the templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] is likely shifting to bigger cities which have more economic opportunities than smaller ones .
This timeline shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] from 2004 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[4] . In 2018 , templateTitle[3] 's average templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] amounted to 0.63 percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[5] templateXLabel[0] . templateTitle[3] 's economy templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[3] has experienced an increase every templateXLabel[0] with the exception of 2009 . Some short-term increases in prices templateYLabel[2] often attributed to wars , which is a fundamental reason for yearly templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[3] . On the other hand , wars often cause spikes in GDP , primarily due to an increased amount of production and reparations . This was not the case for templateTitle[3] , however . GDP , more specifically GDP per capita , remained relatively low as of 2013 , despite increasing annually and ranked as one of the top templateTitle[4] lowest gross domestic product per capita values in 2013 . GDP per capita measures a country 's productivity by using its entire gross domestic product and dividing it by the number of people in the country and is mostly used to templateYLabel[2] one nation with another . From an economic standpoint , templateTitle[3] imported many more goods than they exported , leading to a trade deficit . The country has experienced a trade deficit every templateXLabel[0] over the past decade , most notably in 2011 . Reasons for the ongoing deficit could potentially be the lack of government support for domestic production as well as stiff rules towards marketing . Also , production and transport templateYLabel[2] likely to suffer due to the war . A trade deficit also implicates that a country borrows more money from other nations in order to sustain and fulfill the needs its economy , along with its citizens .
This statistic presents the templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[2] from May templateTitle[6] to July templateTitle[8] . As of the last reported period , the note-taking and productivity app had an estimated templateTitle[6] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] worldwide , up from 150 templateYLabel[4] in July 2015 .
This statistic depicts the templateTitle[0] annual templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] ( templateTitle[5] ) templateTitle[8] templateTitle[9] through 2025* . In 2018 , the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[0] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] ( templateTitle[5] ) stood at 4.2 templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[6] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] templateTitle[6] from templateTitle[7] to templateTitle[9] . There were 1.38 million templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] templateTitle[6] in templateTitle[9] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[2] from 2010 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[3] . In 2018 , the templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[2] was around 25.53 templateYLabel[2] people .
This statistic shows the templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the U.S. from templateTitle[8] to 2018 with additional projections up to templateTitle[10] . The data represents U.S. city averages . The base period was 1982 templateTitle[9] 84 . In economics , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is a measurement of templateYLabel[0] , the templateYLabel[1] of increase of a price index ( in this case : consumer price index ) . It is the percentage templateYLabel[1] of change in prices level over time . The templateYLabel[1] of decrease in the purchasing power of money is approximately equal . According to the forecast , prices will increase by two percent in 2019 . The templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] for previous years can be found here and the consumer price index for all urban consumers here . The monthly templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] for the templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] can also be accessed here . templateYLabel[0] in the U.S. templateYLabel[0] is a term used to describe a general rise in the price of goods and services in an economy over a given period of time . templateYLabel[0] in the templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] is calculated using the consumer price index ( CPI ) . The consumer price index is a measure of change in the price level of a preselected market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households . This forecast of U.S. templateYLabel[0] was prepared by the International Monetary Fund . They templateTitle[0] roughly a 2.25 percent templateTitle[1] rise in the general level of prices until templateTitle[10] . This means that a product bought today for about 100 U.S. dollars will cost about 102.25 U.S. dollars next templateXLabel[0] , and so on . Considering the templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] in recent years , a 2.25 percent templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is a very moderate projection . Although the moderate templateYLabel[0] of prices between templateTitle[8] and 3 percent is considered normal in a modern economy , countries ' central banks try to prevent severe templateYLabel[0] and deflation to keep the growth of prices to a minimum . Severe templateYLabel[0] is considered dangerous to a country 's economy because it can rapidly diminish the population 's purchasing power and thus damage the GDP .
This statistic shows the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) in templateTitle[7] from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[8] . templateYLabel[0] refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per templateXLabel[0] . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . In 2018 , the templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[7] was about 2.08 trillion templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . See global templateYLabel[0] for a global comparison . templateTitle[7] 's economy After increasing significantly year-over-year , templateTitle[7] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) has gone through several fluctuations since the global economic crisis in 2008 . The European Union 's third largest economy has experienced downturns , primarily due to inefficiency with regards to spending and incompetent leadership . When analyzing the country 's budget balance , which is essentially the overall difference between revenues and spending , templateTitle[7] has posted a negative balance , or a state deficit , every templateXLabel[0] over the past decade . However , their budget balance has improved noticeably every templateXLabel[0] since 2009 . Since the country spent more than they earned , national debt continued to rise every templateXLabel[0] , most notably between 2008 and 2009 , and continued to templateYLabel[4] so going into 2014 . templateTitle[7] 's dependency on funding from other countries will lead to further debt , unless it finds a way to decrease spending or increase revenues . Despite the country 's ongoing recession , templateTitle[7] 's templateYLabel[0] ranked the country in the top 10 countries with the largest templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] in 2014 , ahead of economically developed countries such as Canada and Australia . This implies that templateTitle[7] 's economical struggles are more a result of inefficient spending rather than a lack of production .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] of registered active templateYLabel[2] in the United States from templateTitle[6] to templateTitle[8] . In templateTitle[8] , the total templateYLabel[0] of unique , registered templateYLabel[2] who have actively lobbied amounted to 11,862 .
This statistic shows the countries and regions that consumed the most templateTitle[2] in templateTitle[10] . The United States demanded 21.6 percent of the templateTitle[1] 's total templateTitle[2] production . templateYLabel[2] of templateTitle[2] templateTitle[2] is one of the templateTitle[1] 's most valued metals and included within the so called transition metals group . Within living memory , this precious metal always has been used for coins , jewellery and valuable utensils , known as silverware . In modern times , it also developed an important role in industrial usage . Almost half of all templateTitle[2] worldwide is used for such purposes . This is primarily due to its extremely high electric and thermal conductivity . In fact , templateTitle[2] has the highest conductivity of electricity and heat of all elements and metals , respectively . Thus , industrial templateTitle[2] usage is mostly for conductors and catalyses . Another sector which is highly dependent on templateTitle[2] is the photographic industry . templateTitle[2] is also an important factor within the finance and investment sector . Among countries around the templateTitle[1] , the United States is the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[3] of templateTitle[2] . The United States consumes around one fifth of global templateTitle[2] . China , Japan and India templateYLabel[0] following , while Germany and Italy templateYLabel[0] the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[3] from Europe . The latest estimates show that the United States uses between six and eight thousand metric tons annually . With around one thousand metric tons from mines , the United States is also among the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[10] primary templateTitle[2] producers worldwide . Mexico is by far the leading templateTitle[2] producer , extracting more than four thousand metric tons from its templateTitle[2] mines . templateTitle[2] is in most cases obtained as a by-product from zinc , copper and gold mines and refineries . The largest primary templateTitle[2] mines templateYLabel[0] Cannington in Australia and Fresnillo in Mexico .
The statistic shows templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[9] from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[10] . templateYLabel[0] is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a templateXLabel[0] . It is considered to be a very important indicator of the economic strength of a country and a positive change is an indicator of economic growth .

Despite being less of an action-packed game than its predecessors , templateTitle[2] has still proven to be very popular among viewers and it ranked as templateTitle[2] of the most watched games on Twitch in templateTitle[9] , alongside templateTitle[8] of templateTitle[6] . Blizzard Entertainment keeps on bringing out hits templateTitle[2] was created by Blizzard Entertainment , which is also responsible for games such as Starcraft , Diablo and , more recently , Overwatch . The success of the latter undoubtedly contributed to the company generating record revenues in recent years , with the templateTitle[9] figure peaking at 7.5 billion U.S. dollars .

Previously , from 1950 to 1975 , the average templateYLabel[1] hovered around 18 templateYLabel[3] . The increased average templateYLabel[1] corresponds with rising life expectancy globally , accelerating especially around the mid-twentieth century onward . In this century , the life expectancy in templateTitle[6] has increased by roughly 2.5 templateYLabel[3] since 2007 , reaching 75.5 in 2017 . The standard of living is increasing In templateTitle[6] , people ages templateTitle[7] to 64 have consistently made up the majority of the templateTitle[4] from 2007 to 2017 . In this time , the older templateTitle[4] grew increased by about three percent , while the younger templateTitle[4] shrunk at roughly the same rate . This indicates that many people within the middle templateYLabel[1] category are reaching 65 or older , and that the birth rate is simultaneously declining . Birth rates are declining Every templateXLabel[0] , families are having fewer children in templateTitle[6] , with a fertility rate of less than 1.5 children per women of childbearing templateYLabel[1] in 2017 . This is not necessarily a bad sign – it points towards increasing healthcare and living standards . Another indicator for this is the decreasing infant mortality in templateTitle[6] , meaning more of the children born each templateXLabel[0] survive . Lower infant mortality also contributes to the calculations of a higher life expectancy , and thus affects the country 's templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateTitle[3] from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until templateTitle[4] . In 2018 , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] was around 1,290.92 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . For comparison , the Greek templateYLabel[1] amounted to approximately 375 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] that same templateXLabel[0] .

This statistic displays the templateTitle[6] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] ( templateTitle[5] or standardized measure ) of the templateTitle[0] to the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] ( templateTitle[0] GBP ) , according to data provided by the European Central Bank , from the introduction of the templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[9] up until templateTitle[11] . The templateTitle[5] ( standardized ) measure presents the calculation , which is based on many observations throughout the period in question . This is different than an templateTitle[6] measure at a point in time ; the templateTitle[6] measure presents concrete values as of the end of the templateXLabel[0] . Between the years of 2000 and 2009 , the templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[0] to the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] noted a steep increase . In 2009 , the templateTitle[0] to templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[5] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] was equal to 0.89 , which meant that one templateTitle[0] could buy 0.89 templateTitle[2] pounds . By 2016 , this value had decreased , to a value of 0.82 , which again meant that one templateTitle[0] could buy 0.88 templateTitle[2] pounds . The Brexit referendum can be seen as the likely reason for the noted increase in value of templateTitle[0] to templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] in 2017 . Following the referendum result , in June 2016 , the monthly templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] increased and continued to do so for the majority of the rest of the templateXLabel[0] .

The templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] has won 125 Pulitzer Prizes and is widely read in and outside of the United States . As readers have moved away from print and towards digital , the templateTitle[8] chose to capitalize on this . In early 2014 , The templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] 's digital-only news product had fewer than 800 thousand U.S. subscribers , but five years boasts almost three million paid users . The fact that many print-only publications are struggling to retain existing subscribers or appeal to templateTitle[5] ones aptly proves that The templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] made its move at the right templateTitle[7] . Now , NYTimes.com regularly attracts millions of unique visitors each month , and the templateTitle[8] also boasts well over 250 million U.S. dollars in print and digital circulation revenue .

While nearly two-thirds of templateTitle[2] remains rural , templateTitle[0] has grown by seven percent from 2008 to 2018 . Political reforms in the 1980s created greater economic stability in templateTitle[2] in the decade that followed and led to higher templateTitle[0] . The growing templateXLabel[3] of templateTitle[2] , as well as people migrating from rural areas , contributes to an escalating number of inhabitants in the country 's already crowded cities . Agricultural sector becoming less prominent In 2008 , nearly half the templateXLabel[3] of templateTitle[2] worked in agriculture . Ten years later , as more people leave rural areas , the service sector is comparable in size , employing roughly a third of the templateXLabel[3] , while employment in the industry sector has grown to a quarter . Though agriculture has long had the most workers , the service and industry sectors accounted for larger shares of templateTitle[2] 's GDP from 2007 to 2017 . Costs in rural and templateTitle[0] areas In rural areas of templateTitle[2] , investment in agriculture – such as the costs of farming – was the second-highest expense in 2019 . In templateTitle[0] areas , around the same templateXLabel[0] was spent on aspirational living costs such as eating out and holidays , while investment was the category with the least amount of monthly spending . The expense associated with farming in rural areas is a possible cause for the increased migration to cities , with fewer people employed in the agricultural sector and more working in services such as health care , education , hospitality , and gastronomy .

In the last ten years , the annual templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] ranged at around 0.5 percent , although the gradual abolition of the one-child policy from 2014 on led to temporarily higher birth figures . As of templateTitle[6] , leading countries in templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] could almost exclusively be found on the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula . Nevertheless , as of mid 2018 , Asia ranked first by a wide margin among the continents in terms of absolute templateTitle[0] . Future development of Chinese populationThe Chinese templateTitle[0] will soon reach a maximum size and then begin to shrink gradually . However , the exact templateXLabel[0] for this turning point is unclear . Whereas IMF estimates see it coming in the first half of the 2020s , Chinese demographers expect a later date around 2030 . As of 2018 , templateTitle[3] still ranked the world 's most populous country , but India followed closely and will soon take over . Apart from the receding templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] , a clear templateTitle[1] trend in Chinese cities is visible .

By templateTitle[10] , the gross templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] is projected to be about 36.2 trillion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . This would be an increase of about 13.5 trillion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] from templateTitle[8] , when the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] was 22.67 trillion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . The templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateYLabel[4] . The templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] , also called the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] or public templateYLabel[1] , is the amount of templateYLabel[1] held by the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] government . This templateYLabel[1] may be to other countries , or to different departments within the government itself . The public templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] has increased significantly over the past templateTitle[10] years , as it was around 3.2 trillion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] in 1990 and totaled around 22.72 trillion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] in September templateTitle[8] . The problem of the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] Over the past number of years , the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] limit in the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] has been hiked significantly , which in the past few years was done in order to prevent the templateYLabel[4] government from shutting down . The issue of the templateYLabel[4] templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] has put a wedge between Democrats and Republicans , as the two parties are unable to find an effective solution to reduce the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] . When broken down per capita , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] amounted to about 65,600 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] of templateYLabel[1] per person in the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] .
The statistic shows the templateTitle[3] of the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] since the birth of Christ . 6.9 templateYLabel[3] people were living on earth in 2010 .

The most significant driver of this templateYLabel[1] change has been the reduction of global mortality rates . Scientific research and well organized health policy implementation have ensured that epidemics such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic can be combated more effectively to save the lives of those at risk . Declining infant mortality rates are a triumphant example of health improvements , especially in North Africa and the Middle East . Infant mortality rates have also declined in more economically developed countries such as the United States . China and India are now the most populous countries in the templateYLabel[0] , together accounting for over one third of the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] . Recent trends suggest these countries will continue to have high fertility rates until they reach a higher level of economic templateTitle[3] . The trend of fertility rates below 2.1 per women , the rate considered to be necessary to retain the templateYLabel[1] level , is evident in developed countries such as Singapore . However , countries such as Singapore can retain their templateYLabel[1] level through increased immigration rather than increasing fertility rates . Some critics have argued that the issue of templateYLabel[1] rise should regain a prominent place in the international political agenda . Recent studies including a 2014 study at the University of Washington have placed doubt on the claim that the global templateYLabel[1] will peak at 9 templateYLabel[3] around 2050 . The issue is important as growing populations place higher strain on both natural and public resources including healthcare and education .

The shrinking templateYLabel[3] of templateTitle[2] About half of templateTitle[2] 's templateYLabel[3] lives in templateYLabel[2] areas , with the largest city and capital Bucharest only having about 1.9 million inhabitants - not very much considering that templateTitle[2] reported a templateYLabel[3] of about templateTitle[3] million people in 2015 . Bucharest is also significantly larger than any of the other small cities around the country , which only have close to or less than 300,000 inhabitants each . The fact that templateTitle[2] has not urbanized to the same level of most developed countries is an indicator that the country is still developing . As templateTitle[2] progresses , it has an important advantage over other developing nations : It is a member of the European Union , and thus has access to the European market . However , unlike other developing countries , the Romanian templateYLabel[3] is decreasing and expected to shrink by more than half a million by 2020 . This is caused by a low fertility rate , which is less than the replacement rate , by emigration and by an aging templateYLabel[3] . The median age of the Romanian templateYLabel[3] is expected to increase to as high as 44 years in 2020 . A contributing factor to this may be the fact that while the older generation stays in templateTitle[2] , the younger people migrate to other countries within the European Union which have stronger economies and more employment opportunities than templateTitle[2] .

While this can be an interesting measure of how many people live in a country and how large the country is , it does not account for the degree of urbanization , or the share of people who live in urban centers . For example , Russia is the largest country in the world and has a comparatively low templateTitle[0] , so its templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] is very low . However , much of the country is uninhabited , so cities in Russia templateYLabel[4] much more densely populated than the rest of the country . Urbanization in the United States While the United States is not very densely populated compared to other countries , its templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] has increased significantly over the past few decades .

In 2014 , the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] recorded a 2.8 percent growth rate . Many believe that if the economy is stable , the government will reduce spending and not accrue any more templateYLabel[1] , and it can indeed be seen that while government spending continues to increase , the gap between spending and revenue is projected to get smaller . If the government were to earn more than it spends , it could use the money left over to pay the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] and start to reduce it . However , what is even more important is the size of the templateYLabel[1] in relation to the size of the country 's economy ; if the templateYLabel[1] grows slower than the economy , the templateYLabel[1] to GDP ratio can still fall , despite a budget deficit . The ratio of government expenditure to GDP indicates that the economy is recovering at a faster rate than government expenditure , with the ratio decreasing significantly over the last decade and the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in relation to GDP being expected to decrease further as well - albeit slowly . This should help relieve concerns over the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] 's mounting templateYLabel[1] , but for some templateYLabel[1] reduction is just not fast enough .

The development of the world templateTitle[3] from 1950 to 2030 is estimated to be tripled according to United Nations ' data.The majority of the world templateTitle[3] lives in Asia , but the templateTitle[3] in Africa is forecasted to rise from 1,031 in year 2010 up to 4,185 in year 2100 . This forecast is based on the rapid templateYLabel[3] of the developing countries , such as Africa . Developing countries are well known for its urban residents living in slum conditions . A slum is defined as a thickly populated , metropolitan area with bad living conditions and people living below the poverty line.The urban templateTitle[3] in developing countries , who lived in slums has increased steadily for the last decades .

The total templateTitle[0] expenditure in templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] in templateTitle[11] accounted for approximately 8.1 templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[8] 's Gross Domestic Product ( templateYLabel[2] ) that templateXLabel[0] . This was the result of the steepest increase in the past ten years and was the first time templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] as a share of the templateYLabel[2] exceeded eight templateYLabel[0] . This share saw a continuous increase over the past decade , indicating that as the templateYLabel[2] grew , templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] grew at an even faster rate . templateTitle[8] 's templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[0] capita was over 33 thousand U.S. dollars in templateTitle[11] , increased from around 18.2 thousand dollars in 2009 , while overall medical expenses in templateTitle[11] had increased by almost ten templateYLabel[0] over the previous templateXLabel[0] , up to around 14.44 billion templateTitle[7] Korean won ( over 12 million U.S. dollars ) . Nearly 60 templateYLabel[0] of the costs were covered by the government or the public templateTitle[0] insurance system . Higher templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] is still insufficient Even though templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] as a share of the templateYLabel[2] exceeded eight templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[11] , this was lower than the OECD average of 8.8 templateYLabel[0] . Likewise , the government 's templateTitle[0] expenses were around 60 templateYLabel[0] and slightly increased from the previous templateXLabel[0] , but still lower than the OECD average of almost 74 templateYLabel[0] . The increased expenditure was largely attributed to the introduction of what is dubbed `` Moon Jae-In Care '' , named after the current Korean president , much like the American Affordable Care Act is colloquially known as `` Obamacare '' . In short , the government will provide greatly expanded coverage for medical treatments and care , increasing the reimbursement rate of the public templateTitle[0] insurance , along with other measures . In addition , the Korean population as a whole is rapidly aging , and more people than before are being hospitalized and receiving examinations . Koreans already see doctors far more frequently than any other OECD nationals . Strains on templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] and insurance The Korean national public templateTitle[0] insurance system enjoyed seven years of surplus revenue since 2011 but fell into the red in templateTitle[11] . As noted above , Moon Jae-In Care and the aging population are largely responsible . The years ' worth of revenue is projected to run templateTitle[7] in the coming years .
