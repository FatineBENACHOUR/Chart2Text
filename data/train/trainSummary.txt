How many people templateYLabel[2] templateTitle[5] ? Having burst onto the scene in templateXValue[4] , templateTitle[5] has since become a templateTitle[6] phenomenon , amassing almost templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] across the globe as of templateXValue[0] templateXValue[0] . How did templateTitle[5] become so big ? The reasons why templateTitle[5] has become such a global hit are clear to see . Not only is the game free , but it is also available on most gaming platforms . On top of this , the Battle Royale-style , in which up to 100 templateYLabel[2] fight it out at templateYValue[min] time , mean that the re-playability of the game is infinite – each game is unique . The cartoon style of the game unsurprisingly lends itself more to the younger audience , with almost two-thirds of templateTitle[5] 's templateYLabel[2] aged between 18 and 24 . It also seems that it is not just the casual gamers that are attracted to this game as over templateTitle[7] percent of templateTitle[5] fans admitted to devoting over 16 hours to the game per week .

Revenue in the Battle Royale premium console segment amounted to 2.7 billion U.S. dollars in templateXValue[1] and was estimated to more than double to 6.9 billion U.S. dollars in templateXValue[0] . While templateTitle[5] is certainly staking its claim as the king of the Battle Royale games , it faces stiff competition from PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds which , unlike templateTitle[5] , is available on Steam . PUBG peaked at almost 3.24 templateYLabel[4] concurrent templateYLabel[2] on Steam at the beginning on templateXValue[1] and is still regularly peaking at over templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[4] concurrent templateYLabel[2] . It seems that game developers are looking to cash in on this ever-growing market , so could new games such as Apex Legends also pose a threat to templateTitle[5] 's supremacy ?
The statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the templateTitle[4] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket . This product basket contains products and services , on which the average consumer spends money throughout the templateXLabel[0] . They include expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , power , telecommunications , recreational activities and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . In templateXValue[6] , the average templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the templateTitle[4] was about templateYValue[4] percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[4] templateXLabel[0] .

Unemployment within the country , in spite of a slight increase over the past several years , has remained relatively low in comparison many other European countries that were equally as affected by recession .
The statistic depicts templateTitle[9] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . templateYLabel[0] refers to the total market value of all goods and services that templateYLabel[3] produced within a country per templateXLabel[0] . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . Real templateYLabel[0] is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic templateYLabel[1] . In templateXValue[6] , templateTitle[9] 's real templateYLabel[0] grew by about templateYValue[max] percent templateYLabel[3] to the templateYLabel[5] templateXLabel[0] . Trade balance of templateTitle[9] With the exception of 2009 , templateTitle[9] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] was relatively stable year-over-year , however at a higher templateYLabel[2] prior to the financial crisis . In 2012 , templateTitle[9] reported a trade surplus , meaning that more goods and services combined were exported than imported . However , templateTitle[9] primarily profited from exporting goods , earning the majority of its revenues from its trade balance of goods , while the nation posted a trade deficit on its services , its highest loss recorded since 2003 . templateTitle[9] imports and exports its products and services primarily to neighboring countries or countries in Europe . templateTitle[9] 's most important trade partner is arguably China , potentially due to shared borders and strong political relations between the templateYValue[2] nations . China is accountable for roughly 19.2 percent of all of templateTitle[9] 's imports , however only makes up roughly 8.3 percent of the country 's total exports . China has become an important import partner for many nations around the world as well as a country where larger companies can manufacture goods at a cheaper price .
What is the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of residential property in the templateXValue[last] ? In the fourth quarter of templateTitle[8] , a templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] cost approximately 344,000 templateYLabel[3] . There were large differences between the Dutch provinces , however . templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] were most expensive in the central templateTitle[11] of templateXValue[6] with an templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of 454,000 templateYLabel[3] , whereas a similar house in templateXValue[0] had an templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] tag of 225,000 templateYLabel[3] . Overall , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] a private individual would pay when buying any type of existing residential property ( such as templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] but also , for example , an apartment ) was approximately 287,000 templateYLabel[3] in 2018 .

This is an effect of past developments : the templateYLabel[1] to rent ratio ( the nominal purchase templateYLabel[1] of a house divided templateTitle[10] the annual rent of a similar place ) shows that for a long time it was relatively cheaper to buy a property in the templateXValue[last] than to rent templateTitle[8] . Life for rent : mortgages in the templateXValue[last] Additionally , the templateXValue[last] has templateTitle[8] of the highest mortgage debts among private individuals in Europe .

In the templateXValue[last] , this system is known as hypotheekrenteaftrek . Note that since 2014 , the Dutch government is slowly scaling this down with a planned acceleration from 2020 onwards .

It increases when the total money supply of a country increases , causing the money 's value to decrease , and prices to increase again in turn . Nowadays the term `` templateYLabel[0] '' is used more or less synonymously with `` price level increase '' . Its opposite is deflation , which , in short , means a decrease of the price level . templateTitle[3] and its economy have been severely affected by the financial crisis of templateXValue[16] ( as can be seen above ) , when the real estate bubble imploded and caused the demand for goods and services to decrease and the unemployment templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] to increase dramatically . Even though deflation only occurred for one templateXLabel[0] in templateXValue[15] and the price level has been increasing since , templateTitle[3] 's economy still has a long way to go until full recovery . Apart from the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] and the unemployment templateYLabel[1] , gross domestic product / GDP growth in templateTitle[3] and the trade balance of goods in templateTitle[3] , i.e . the exports of goods minus the imports , templateYLabel[2] additional indicators of templateTitle[3] 's desolate condition during the economic crisis and its slow and difficult recovery ever since . Still , there is a silver lining for templateTitle[3] 's economy . All in all , things seems to be improving economically , albeit slowly ; many key indicators templateYLabel[2] starting to stabilize or even pick up again , while others still have some recovering to do .

Despite being not only a European but also a global economic power , templateTitle[9] struggled with maintaining a low unemployment templateTitle[7] and experienced a significant increase in unemployment after the 2008 crash , just like many other prominent industrial countries . However , unlike these other nations , unemployment continued to rise well into the 2010s , while the employment situations in neighboring and international countries improved almost every templateXLabel[0] . The lack of working opportunities is related to the Eurozone crisis that primarily affected southern European countries , such as Spain , Portugal and Italy .

The templateTitle[4] , or standardized , measure shows the calculation based on observations throughout the period in question , which is different than an templateTitle[5] measure at point in time : concrete values as of the end of the templateXLabel[0] . Between the years of templateXValue[19] and templateXValue[3] , the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[0] to the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] noted a steep increase . In templateXValue[10] , the templateTitle[0] to templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] was equal to templateYValue[10] , which meant that templateTitle[8] templateTitle[0] could buy templateYValue[10] templateTitle[2] rubles . By templateXValue[3] this value had increased overall , to a value of templateYValue[max] which meant that templateTitle[8] templateTitle[0] could buy templateYValue[max] templateTitle[2] rubles . This increase in templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[0] to templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is reflected in the monthly templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in recent years . As of templateXValue[1] the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[0] to the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] was templateYValue[1] .

He pledged and supported the separation of lending and investment banks , as well as proposing sweeping changes to the French tax system . The introduction of the measure of capping tax loopholes at a maximum of ten thousand euros per templateXLabel[0] and questioning the solidarity tax on wealth , the annual direct wealth tax on those with assets in excess of 1.3 million , were also part of Hollande 's proposals . The President has also signalled his intention to implement an income tax rate of 75 percent on revenue earned above one million euros per templateXLabel[0] . He stated the allocation of the revenue from this tax would be used to develop the deprived suburbs and to balance the templateYLabel[0] 's budget by templateXValue[7] . templateTitle[3] is a country brimming with big business and millionaires . The templateYLabel[0] is home to the most millionaires in Europe ; 2.6 million in total .
The timeline shows templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[1] , templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] global templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] amounted to about templateYValue[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] dollars.WalmartWal-Mart was founded in 1962 by Sam Walton when he and his brother James `` Bud '' Walton opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in Rogers , Arkansas . Since then , Wal-Mart has grown to become the largest publicly-owned retail company in the templateTitle[4] . In the United States , the company includes Wal-Mart discount stores , Supercenters , Neighborhood Markets , and Sam templateTitle[1] Club warehouse membership clubs . The company also has many international operations . Wal-Mart is considered a variety store which focuses on low prices featuring apparel as well as hard goods , and has been committed to upholding their basic value of customer service.Beginning in the early 1990s , Wal-Mart went to great lengths to increase their market share . They introduced a full line of groceries into their stores , diversified their market by appealing to certain ethnic groups through bilingual advertisements , and took steps to promote the awareness of environmental issues.In templateXValue[2] , Wal-Mart operated over eleven thousand stores templateTitle[4] ; with 4,672 of those stores located in the United States alone . Even though Wal-Mart has been criticized for their low wages , they claim to templateYLabel[2] a lot of good for lower income households . Figures show that a family can save about templateTitle[8] thousand templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] a templateXLabel[1] with their ability to cut prices on some products , such as toys , by thirty percent in order to stimulate more templateTitle[3] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[2] in the United States templateTitle[6] templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[max] , the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] ( aged templateTitle[7] years and older ) in templateTitle[2] amounted to approximately templateYValue[0] templateYLabel[4] .
As of templateXValue[max] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of templateTitle[4] was templateYValue[max] thousand templateYLabel[4] per templateXLabel[0] , a growth of just over 5.8 thousand templateYLabel[4] when compared with templateXValue[min] . From templateXValue[min] until templateXValue[11] , templateYLabel[2] rose by less than a thousand templateYLabel[4] , with templateYLabel[2] growth accelerating mainly in the period after templateXValue[8] . The 607 templateYLabel[4] increase recorded between templateXValue[8] and templateXValue[7] was the largest templateYLabel[2] rise seen during this period . Comparisons with rest of the templateYLabel[4] Within the European Union Luxembourg had an templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] salary of over 71 thousand U.S dollars , with templateTitle[4] having an templateYLabel[1] salary comparable to other large European Countries , such as the United Kingdom and France . In neighboring Poland , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] salary was just over 13 thousand U.S dollars , meaning that templateTitle[4] 's earned , on templateYLabel[0] , more than three times what their Polish counterparts did . templateTitle[4] economy slowing in 2019 While templateTitle[4] initially had templateTitle[7] of the strongest recoveries from the templateXValue[10] financial crash and as of templateXValue[max] had the largest economy in Europe its economy has started to slow in recent years . For 2019 the templateTitle[4] economy is forecasted to grow at a rate of only 0.75 percent , compared with 2.46 percent in templateXValue[1] . Although the economic outlook is set to improve slightly in 2020 , it remains to be seen if the low levels of growth predicted in the coming years will have an impact on templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[2] .
The statistic shows the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[9] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[7] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[7] , the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[9] was around templateYValue[7] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . For further information , see templateTitle[9] 's templateYLabel[0] . templateTitle[9] 's economy templateTitle[9] is the world 's second largest developed economy and a member of the Group of Eight , also known as G8 , which is comprised of the eight leading industrialized countries . Due to a weak financial sector , overregulation and a lack of demand , templateTitle[9] suffered substantially from the early 1990s until templateXValue[24] , a time referred to as ‘ 'The Lost Decade ' _ ' . templateTitle[9] 's economy is still slowly recovering from the country 's asset price bubble collapse ; however it continues to struggle to retain economic milestones achieved in the 1980s . templateTitle[9] 's response to the crash was to stimulate the economy , which in turn resulted in extensive amounts of debt that further increased into the 21st century , most notably after the templateXValue[16] financial crisis . Despite maintaining a surprisingly low unemployment rate , demand within the country remains inadequate , primarily because Japanese residents spend a rather small fraction of the money they earned from the workplace . Lower demand often has a direct effect on production , with companies seeing not enough profits to continue production at such a high rate . Based on the consumer confidence index , Japanese households found that their quality of life , income growth , employment and propensity to durable goods was below satisfactory standards , perhaps due to these households still experiencing the effects of the 1990s bubble crash .
templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[0] reached an all-time high as of templateTitle[6] , when templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] auto industry sold some 21 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . This figure is almost double the templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[1] , when just templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[3] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[4] were sold in templateTitle[0] . templateTitle[2] industry in templateTitle[0] In templateTitle[6] , templateTitle[2] vehicles also made up the majority of vehicles in production in templateTitle[0] , followed by passenger vehicles . There are many kinds of templateTitle[2] vehicles available in templateTitle[0] , including scooters , motorcycles , and mopeds . As of 2018 , the leading templateTitle[2] manufacturer in templateTitle[0] was Hero MotoCorp . The manufacturer of the highly sought-after Splendor motorcycle model is headquartered in templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] capital New Delhi . Major automotive brands in IndiaMotor templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[0] have doubled between 2008 and 2018 . Among passenger cars , Maruti Suzuki , followed by Hyundai Motor of templateTitle[0] , holds a majority of the market . templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] best-selling cars in 2018 included models such as Alto , Swift Dzire and Baleno , to name a few .
Canadians aged between templateXValue[1] and templateXValue[1] had the highest rate of templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] nationally as of December templateTitle[10] . Some templateYValue[max] percent of survey templateYLabel[2] in this templateTitle[9] group stated that they consumed templateTitle[5] of any form in the templateTitle[0] three templateTitle[2] . Those aged templateXValue[last] or templateXValue[last] had the lowest levels of templateTitle[6] , with just templateYValue[min] percent of templateYLabel[2] consuming templateTitle[5] in this time . templateTitle[9] related opinions on legalization templateTitle[7] became only the second country worldwide to legalize the use of templateTitle[3] for recreational purposes in all provinces in October 2018 . Unsurprisingly , most Canadians who approved of this legalization when surveyed in October 2018 , were aged between 18 and templateXValue[1] . The highest rates of disapproval came from those aged templateXValue[last] or over . Canadians aged 18 to templateXValue[1] have also been the most active in the post-legalization templateTitle[5] market . For example , around templateXValue[1] percent of this templateTitle[9] group had visited a website that sells templateTitle[5] online and 17 percent had used templateTitle[5] in October 2018 .
The statistic depicts the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] as of June templateTitle[8] . That year , e-commerce company Amazon 's templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] was templateYValue[1] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . templateXValue[3] , the parent company of search templateYLabel[0] leader Google , had a templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateYValue[3] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . The end of the 1990 in the United States saw the rise of a great number of templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] , also called online templateTitle[6] or a variety of the name `` dot templateTitle[6] , '' where the `` .com '' domain is derived from the word commercial . At the time , such startups were merely riding the wave of early templateTitle[5] business , but had little capital and perhaps templateTitle[8] good idea . Few templateTitle[6] have survived the burst of the dot templateTitle[6] bubble and even fewer have managed to become internationally successful . A few notable exceptions are American templateTitle[6] such as Google ( founded in 1998 ) , Amazon ( founded in 1994 ) or templateXValue[last] Inc. ( founded in 1995 ) , and the Chinese online giant templateXValue[5] ( founded in 1998 ) , which have come to be some of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] in the templateTitle[7] . Topping the ranking of templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] is currently templateXValue[3] , the parent company of Google , with a templateYLabel[0] capitalization of templateYValue[3] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] as of June templateTitle[8] . Having started as a PhD project at Stanford University , the Google project slowly gained traction and is now the number templateTitle[8] search engine in the templateTitle[7] , with a templateYLabel[0] share of 90 percent on the search engine templateYLabel[0] . Due to a number of high profile acquisitions , Google has expanded its portfolio beyond search , to include the video content sharing site YouTube , the digital app templateXLabel[0] Google Play Store , the webmail service Gmail and the web browser Google Chrome , to only name a few . As of March templateTitle[8] , it is also the most visited multi-platform website in the United States , with almost 256 million templateYLabel[4] unique visitors during that month alone . In October 2015 , Google reorganized itself into a newly created parent company , the multinational conglomerate templateXValue[3] Inc . The biggest templateTitle[5] templateTitle[6] in terms of their workforce are currently Amazon , Google and templateXValue[last] .
The statistic depicts the total templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] in the United States from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . The total templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] in the templateYLabel[4] amounted to approximately 15.4 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] in templateXValue[max] . templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] – additional information The amount of templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the United States has decreased since templateXValue[10] making it appear that Americans are trying to reduce their templateYLabel[1] and stock up on savings as a result of the economic crisis . While this may be true , decreases in templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] can be mainly attributed to decreases in templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[2] on family residences and not all of this templateYLabel[1] reduction has come willingly . High numbers of housing unit foreclosures have likely reduced templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] overall , in addition to templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] restructuring and short-sales . The result of which would have had a great impact on templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] overall , given the fact that household templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] composes by far the largest share of household templateYLabel[1] ) and because the total value of templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the United States is around 10 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . However , it is not only templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] that has contributed to this decrease , but also nonfarm and non-residential property has probably made a significant impact as well . In contrast , mortgages on multifamily residences and farm properties increase from templateXLabel[0] to templateXLabel[0] . Their value , however , is much smaller than the templateTitle[6] of the previously mentioned debts and as such does n't have a big impact on the total value of templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the templateYLabel[4] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[1] of the real templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) in templateTitle[8] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . The real templateYLabel[0] is also known as economic templateYLabel[1] . In templateXValue[6] , the templateYLabel[1] of the real templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[8] was at approximately templateYValue[6] percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[4] templateXLabel[0] . templateTitle[8] 's economy Based on economic standards , templateTitle[8] is recognized as an emerging market and is one of the world 's newly industrialized countries , having earned a place in the Group of templateTitle[9] , which is a group consisting of the templateTitle[9] most important economies in the world . templateTitle[8] 's economical significance is partially attributed to the country 's templateYLabel[1] , especially during the recent global financial recession . While countries around the world struggled to templateYLabel[1] , let alone maintain a balanced economy , templateTitle[8] experienced a rather high percentage of templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[1] annually . Additionally , templateTitle[8] 's financial sector saw significant improvements , most notably with the country 's inflation , which reached rates lower than those prior to the financial crash and even the lowest in a decade . With a rapidly growing populace as well as having had one of the fastest growing economies in Europe and the world , templateTitle[8] managed to maintain a stable and unchanged unemployment rate over the past decade , with the exception of 2009 . However , despite a significant spike in unemployment , templateTitle[8] 's competent management helped bring the total unemployment rate to single digits for the first time in many years .
This graph depicts the templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateYLabel[0] of the National Basketball Association from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[max] , the templateYLabel[0] had an estimated templateYLabel[1] of 1.51 billion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] .
Between templateXValue[17] and the first half of templateXValue[1] , the overall templateTitle[3] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[5] increased by approximately 4.53 templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] to templateYValue[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] . This was the highest templateTitle[1] during this period . templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] were at their lowest in the first half of templateXValue[17] at templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] . Danish templateTitle[3] spent the most templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] of templateTitle[0] throughout Europe in templateXValue[1] , with templateTitle[1] slightly more expensive than in Germany . Energy taxes highest in Copenhagen templateTitle[6] of the reasons templateTitle[2] the high templateTitle[1] of templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[5] is that taxes account templateTitle[2] a large proportion of the overall templateTitle[1] . As of January templateXValue[0] , energy taxes made up a share of approximately 16 percent of the average templateYLabel[0] residential end-user templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] structure . In the Danish capital Copenhagen , however , energy taxes amounted to 41 percent . This was by far the highest energy taxation in major European cities . High quality templateTitle[0] supply Whilst templateTitle[3] in templateTitle[5] pay some of the highest templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] around , the templateTitle[0] supply is ranked as templateTitle[6] of the best in the world with an index score of 6.8 out of a possible 7 . Only Scandinavian neighbor Norway , Singapore and Switzerland had a higher ranking than templateTitle[5] in templateXValue[1] .
This timeline shows templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[max] , templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] amounted to about 21.92 billion templateYLabel[3] . templateTitle[1] The templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] is the largest sporting goods manufacturer across Europe and the second largest templateTitle[6] – only behind long-term competitor Nike . The company manufactures sports clothing as well as other products such as bags , shirts , watches , eyewear , and other sports- and clothing-related goods . It is headquartered in Herzogenaurach , Germany , but has further major locations all over the templateTitle[6] . templateTitle[1] was founded in 1949 and employs around 57,000 employees templateTitle[6] . The company name has originated templateTitle[7] its founder : ‘ templateTitle[1] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[7] Adolf and ‘ templateTitle[1] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[7] Dassler templateTitle[3] _.The sportswear company sells products under their brand names templateTitle[1] , Reebok and TaylorMade . The templateTitle[1] official brand logo is characterized by the three stripes and the three leaves symbolizing the Olympic spirit which combines the three continental plates . The templateTitle[1] brand was rated among the most valuable German brands in templateXValue[1] and enjoys a great brand loyalty among consumers of both genders . Reebok is known as a global sports brand and TaylorMade is mainly operating in the golf business.According to the latest annual report , the templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] of the templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[6] amounted to about 21.22 billion templateYLabel[3] in templateXValue[1] . The company templateYLabel[0] are divided in the following product categories : footwear , apparel and hardware . Footwear captured the largest templateYLabel[0] share in 2017.Besides selling sporting goods , the templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] has repeatedly sponsored a range of sport clubs involved in a large variety of different sports . However , the marketing focus of their sponsorship still focuses on the team sport of soccer .
Between January templateTitle[12] and December templateTitle[14] , the lowest templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[0] raindays occurred in September templateTitle[12] , when just templateYValue[18] templateYLabel[2] recorded 1mm or more of templateTitle[3] . The highest templateYLabel[0] of raindays was recorded in January of the same year , at templateYValue[max] . Fourth quarter the wettest The wettest periods of the year tend to be the start and the end . In 2018 , the fourth quarter was the wettest , with an average of 452 mm of rainfall . November and December of the same year recorded the highest levels of templateTitle[0] rainfall after January , at 122.6 and 119.5 mm respectively . Regional weather Due to the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] 's geographical location and landscape , weather conditions can vary greatly . Scotland has on average been the wettest country since 2010 . The majority of rainfall is concentrated in the Scottish Highlands , as precipitation often occurs in mountainous regions . As rainfall comes in from the Atlantic , it is the northern and western parts of the templateTitle[10] that are most susceptible to precipitation . This explains why England is the driest of all the regions , as templateTitle[3] deposits reduce as they move east .
The templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] of the templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] of templateTitle[4] ( NAR ) has steadily increased since templateXValue[7] , reaching a membership of templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[max] , an all-time high . This trend also reflects the recovery of the property market after the financial crisis of 2007 templateTitle[10] templateXValue[min] , as the volume of home sales began to climb from templateXValue[8] . The NAR is a North American trade templateTitle[2] for templateTitle[4] estate workers formed in 1908 and currently based in Chicago , Illinois . Employment in the templateTitle[4] estate sector The upward in NRA membership is mirrored in overall employment in the templateTitle[4] estate sector in the United States . In templateXValue[3] , 1.6 templateYLabel[4] people were employed in the sector , which indicates that the majority of workers are templateYLabel[2] of the NAR . Employment in the sector is set to increase in firms with less than 2,500 employees until 2026 . Larger firms – those with 2,500 employees or more – are forecast to decrease the templateYLabel[0] of employees in the near future . Membership growth ties in with growth in home sales The growth in NAR membership also correlates with the growth of residential property sales . For instance , the templateYLabel[0] of new houses sold in the templateTitle[0] has been on the rise since templateXValue[8] . American adults as a whole have been steady in their view that home ownership is an important part of the American Dream . However , the share of American Millennials – those born between 1981 and 1996 templateTitle[10] who view homeownership as important has been fluctuating since templateXValue[9] . This adds an element of uncertainty to the future of the housing market , because Millennials are in their mid-twenties and thirties , which is widely viewed as the best time to buy a home from a home equity perspective .
In templateTitle[0] , the templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[2] was expected to reach templateYValue[4] templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[4] , indicating an increase from templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[min] . By templateXValue[4] , templateTitle[0] 's population was predicted to reach 95.5 templateYLabel[4] . Next to Youtube , templateTitle[4] was the leading social media platform in templateTitle[0] in templateXValue[5] . Overall , the country had a 64 percent active social media penetration rate . templateYLabel[2] demographics templateTitle[0] was seventh among the countries with the highest templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[2] as of July templateXValue[4] . templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[0] were mostly between 18 and 34 years old , of which about templateYValue[max] percent were male . The templateYLabel[2] primarily engage with video and photo posts or templateYLabel[2] templateTitle[4] Messenger as their main social media messenger . In templateTitle[0] , templateTitle[4] is also a popular platform for selling goods and services , similar to its neighboring countries . templateTitle[4] in Southeast Asia As of the second quarter of templateXValue[4] , the social network was accessed by over 2.4 billion templateYLabel[2] worldwide on a monthly basis , of which almost 947 templateYLabel[4] were from the Asia Pacific region . As of the first quarter of templateXValue[4] , templateTitle[4] has generated 2.6 billion U.S. dollars of advertising revenue in that region .
The templateYLabel[3] , followed templateTitle[6] templateXValue[1] , had the highest templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] to stay in a templateTitle[3] as of templateTitle[8] . At that time the templateTitle[3] costs templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] in the templateYLabel[3] were on templateYLabel[0] templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . In comparison , the templateTitle[3] costs templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] in templateXValue[last] stood at an templateYLabel[0] of templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . Even templateXValue[1] , also a very expensive templateXLabel[0] , had significantly lower costs than the templateXValue[0] templateXValue[0] . Number of templateYLabel[3] hospitalsThe number of templateYLabel[3] hospitals has decreased in recent years with some increase in 2017 . There are several types of hospitals in the templateYLabel[3] with different ownerships . In general there are more hospitals with a non-profit ownership in the templateYLabel[3] than there are hospitals with state/local government or for-profit ownership . templateYLabel[3] templateTitle[3] costs Health care expenditures in the templateYLabel[3] are among the highest in the world . templateTitle[6] the end of 2019 , templateTitle[3] care expenditures alone across the templateYLabel[3] are expected to exceed 1.2 trillion templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . Among the most expensive medical conditions treated in templateYLabel[3] hospitals are septicemia , osteoarthritis and live births . There are different ways to pay for templateTitle[3] costs in the templateXValue[0] templateXValue[0] . Among all payers of templateYLabel[3] templateTitle[3] costs , Medicare and private payers are paying the largest proportion of all costs .
Between templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] , templateTitle[7] in the templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] in the United Kingdom ( templateTitle[0] ) has fallen . In templateXValue[max] , the templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] of people employed in this templateTitle[2] in the templateTitle[0] amounted to approximately templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[4] . This was a decrease compared to pre-global recession figures , when on the British market there were 1.2 templateYLabel[4] people were employed in all subsectors of templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] . These figures have decreased as a result of the crisis and closer of bank branches across the country , to approximately templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[9] , but since then they noted a rocky few years fluctuating between nearly templateYValue[7] and templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] . templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] The trend for the templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[2] in the United Kingdom can be seen in contrast to estimations for London , as templateTitle[11] of the leading centers of international finance . Overall the templateYLabel[0] of finance and insurance templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[2] in London is forecast to grow over the coming years . templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] , which include banks , credit unions , credit-card companies , accountancy firms , insurance companies as well as templateTitle[1] templateTitle[6] companies are an integral part of any economy . The banking templateTitle[2] assets as percentage of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was approximately 380 percent in templateXValue[1] .
The statistic shows the degree of templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] and details the percentage of the entire templateYLabel[3] , living in templateYLabel[2] areas . In templateXValue[max] , templateYValue[max] percent of the total templateYLabel[3] in templateTitle[2] lived in cities . templateTitle[2] 's rural exodus templateTitle[2] is templateTitle[3] of the largest countries in the world regarding land area , second behind Russia . However , Canada´s inhabitants - like the majority of people around the world - prefer to live in cities where there templateYLabel[0] more possibilities to work and play . The country is part of North America , the most urbanized continent in the world . In templateXValue[4] , almost 82 percent of templateTitle[2] was urbanized , i.e . more than 80 percent of the Canadian templateYLabel[3] lived in cities . The manufacturing , finance , construction and trade that occurs within their boundaries help fuel the economy of templateYLabel[2] areas . While mining and oil and gas extraction compose a large templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[2] 's GDP and templateYLabel[0] often located in rural areas , they do not provide many jobs . Furthermore , agriculture , which was once of primary importance to the economy of rural areas , no longer plays the same role and makes up only a small templateYLabel[0] of both GDP and employment . In templateTitle[2] , people primarily migrate to the larger cities such as Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver . As these cities and others attract young adults , this leaves less of them who stay and start families in rural areas . As a consequence , rural areas templateYLabel[0] experiencing a templateYLabel[3] decline as rural births do not compensate for templateYLabel[2] migration . Shrinking rural areas and growing templateYLabel[2] areas will place demands on both templateYLabel[2] and rural infrastructure in templateTitle[2] and around the world .

A large and efficient economy has helped templateTitle[9] attain a spot as a member of the G7 and G8 , as well as the European Union . After the Second World War , templateTitle[9] experienced a significant economic boost due to support from the ‘ 'Free World ' _ ' , which is a term used to identify non-communist countries during the Cold War . But several decades of economic templateYLabel[1] came to an end after the 2008 recession ; from roughly 2007 to 2011 , the Italian 's encountered multiple setbacks that shrunk the national economy and dramatically affected the country as a whole . Debt became a major problem and templateTitle[9] saw annual national debt templateYLabel[1] primarily due to the country 's inability to maintain its budget properly as well as an overall decrease in templateYLabel[0] . As a result , investors often questioned the country 's ability to pay off its debts without incurring further debt , particularly due to the country 's large debt-to-GDP ratio , which remains one of the highest in the world .

Economical disasters such as the global financial crisis of 2008 and the euro debt crisis left the Spanish economy with long-term obstacles that the Spanish government has yet to overcome . One of the nation 's main economic struggles resides in unemployment , which was not only considerably high to start the decade but continued to templateYLabel[1] to precarious volumes , most notably since 2008 . Despite similar economical conflicts in neighboring countries , templateTitle[8] suffers from one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe , only surpassed by Greece . The Spanish economy prospers from a low import-high export method which was initially implemented after the global financial crisis in order to help the country become more profitable . The country 's exports reached pre-crisis levels and saw continuous templateYLabel[1] over the years , to the point that templateTitle[8] became one of the world 's top exporters . Despite the economic slump due to the crisis , templateTitle[8] now seems to recover slowly and forecasts templateYLabel[3] rather optimistic , in templateXValue[min] , templateTitle[8] was even among the countries with the largest templateYLabel[0] worldwide .

'' . It was found that listening to templateXValue[0] was the most practiced templateTitle[0] activity templateXValue[1] a templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] of templateYValue[max] percent of templateYLabel[2] , followed very closely by templateYValue[1] percent of templateYLabel[2] who stated that they templateXValue[1] templateXValue[1] templateXValue[1] templateXValue[1] in their free time templateXValue[1] . Even though templateXValue[0] is a very popular activity , it seems that French templateXValue[2] would probably not choose to templateXValue[0] to templateXValue[0] if they had more free time . Lack of time is templateYValue[min] of the main obstacles to templateTitle[0] activity . Alongside templateXValue[1] listening to templateXValue[0] , going templateXValue[1] templateXValue[1] templateXValue[1] was also a popular activity . The survey was carried templateXValue[1] via computer-assisted telephone interviews , also known as CATI , and collected data from 1,000 templateYLabel[2] . Since the possibilities of chosen templateTitle[0] templateXValue[last] obviously do n't conflict templateXValue[1] each other as they may be attended on different occasions , templateYLabel[2] were able to choose multiple answers resulting in a valuable ranking of templateTitle[0] templateXValue[last] .
Here you can see a templateTitle[0] templateTitle[0] the templateYLabel[1] of templateTitle[1] Glasses from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . The source predicts that templateTitle[1] 's product will sell well and that by templateXValue[max] will sell more than 21 templateYLabel[3] units .
In templateXValue[max] , the median templateTitle[8] templateTitle[9] of templateYLabel[0] and templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] in the United States was templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . This is an increase from templateXValue[min] , when median templateTitle[8] templateTitle[9] were at templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . templateTitle[8] templateTitle[3] The United States national minimum templateYLabel[0] is 7.25 templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] per templateTitle[8] , which has been the minimum templateYLabel[0] since templateXValue[9] . However , each state has the agency to set their state minimum templateYLabel[0] . Furthermore , each city is able to create their minimum templateYLabel[0] . Many argue that the minimum templateYLabel[0] is too low and should be raised , because it is not considered a living templateYLabel[0] . There has been a movement to raise the minimum templateYLabel[0] to templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] per templateTitle[8] , called `` Fight for templateYValue[max] . '' The District of Columbia had the highest minimum templateYLabel[0] as of January templateTitle[10] , 2019 . templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] On the other hand , templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] in the United States templateYLabel[4] not get paid on an templateTitle[8] basis .

This allowed templateTitle[3] to export more goods than it imported . This high trade balance of goods resulted in a low templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateXValue[12] , the lowest recorded templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] since templateXValue[20] .
In a world where people are constantly on the move and seeking templateXValue[18] forms of entertainment to make their journeys templateXValue[1] faster , mobile templateTitle[2] is bigger than ever .

In that tournament , England were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual champions , Argentina , captained by templateXValue[11] Maradona . Somewhat surprisingly , the Argentinian legend does not feature in the top templateTitle[4] leading goalscorers at the templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] . Alone at the top of this list is Germany 's Miroslav Klose , who scored his sixteenth and record-breaking templateYLabel[2] in Germany 's semi-final matchup with Brazil at the 2014 templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] .

Educating the future workforce will be important , because the economy is growing as well and is templateTitle[7] of the largest in the world . Failing to do this could lead to high youth unemployment and political consequences . However , a productive and young workforce could provide huge economic returns for templateTitle[6] .

The templateTitle[5] , or standardized , measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question , which is different than an templateTitle[4] measure at point in time : this denotes concrete values as of the end of the templateXLabel[0] . Between the years of templateXValue[18] and templateXValue[15] , the templateTitle[5] templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[0] to the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] noted a steep increase . In templateXValue[15] , the templateTitle[0] to templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] was equal to templateYValue[max] , which meant that templateTitle[8] templateTitle[0] could buy templateYValue[max] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] . It dipped at the height of global recession , in templateXValue[11] . Between templateXValue[9] and templateXValue[3] the value increased overall , to templateYValue[3] which meant that templateTitle[8] templateTitle[0] could buy templateYValue[3] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] before falling once again in templateXValue[max] to templateYValue[0] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] . This overall increase in an templateTitle[5] templateTitle[4] templateTitle[0] to templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is also reflected in the monthly templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in recent years , although in this case the values are measured at templateTitle[8] point in time ( end of month ) .
This statistic shows the total templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[6] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[max] , about templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[4] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[2] were living in templateTitle[6] , compared to templateYValue[8] templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[8] .
templateXValue[0] had the highest templateYLabel[0] volume of templateTitle[0] seeds of any country in the world in the 2018/2019 crop year . During that time period , templateXValue[0] produced around 15 templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] of templateTitle[0] seeds . templateXValue[1] is also a templateTitle[4] producer of templateTitle[0] seeds worldwide . templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] oil templateTitle[6] of the main commodities that can be produced from templateTitle[0] seeds is templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] oil , which is a popular cooking oil . In addition to being the world 's leading producer of templateTitle[0] seeds , templateXValue[0] also exports the highest volume of templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] oil of any country . In the United States , domestic consumption of templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] oil was increasing between 2015 and 2017 but dropped in consumption volume in templateTitle[6] . Leading types of edible oils in the United States Vegetable oils are a staple in American households and restaurants , used in pan-frying , deep-frying , salad dressings , and more .

Of all the templateTitle[4] edible oil types in the United States , templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] oil is the second to least popular , with a consumption volume higher than only that of peanut oil .
The statistic shows the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] of templateTitle[3] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[6] , the estimated templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] in templateTitle[3] amounted to approximately 1.33 billion people . templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] in templateTitle[3] templateTitle[3] currently has the second-largest templateTitle[1] in the world and is projected to overtake top-ranking China within forty years . Its residents comprise more than one-seventh of the entire world 's templateTitle[1] , and despite a slowly decreasing fertility rate ( which still exceeds the replacement rate and keeps the median age of the templateTitle[1] relatively low ) , an increasing life expectancy adds to an expanding templateTitle[1] . In comparison with other countries whose populations are decreasing , such as Japan , templateTitle[3] has a relatively small share of aged templateTitle[1] , which indicates the probability of lower death rates and higher retention of the existing templateTitle[1] . With a land mass of less than half that of the United States and a templateTitle[1] almost templateTitle[4] times greater , templateTitle[3] has recognized potential problems of its growing templateTitle[1] . Government attempts to implement family planning programs have achieved varying degrees of success . Initiatives such as sterilization programs in the 1970s have been blamed for creating general antipathy to family planning , but the combined efforts of various family planning and contraception programs have helped halve fertility rates since the 1960s . The templateTitle[1] growth rate has correspondingly shrunk as well , but has not yet reached less than one percent growth per templateXLabel[0] . As home to thousands of ethnic groups , hundreds of languages , and numerous religions , a cohesive and broadly-supported effort to reduce templateTitle[1] growth is difficult to create . Despite that , templateTitle[3] is one country to watch in coming years . It is also a growing economic power ; among other measures , its GDP per capita was expected to triple between 2003 and 2013 and was listed as the third-ranked country for its share of the global gross domestic product .
The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] in the United States increased moderately in the templateXValue[5] 's , rising from templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[min] to templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[max] . templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] A templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] is a treatment templateTitle[2] nails which already have a templateTitle[3] polish applied , and is designed to templateTitle[4] in the small gap that occurs between the cuticle and the base of the templateTitle[3] polish after several weeks of growth . templateTitle[3] polishes can either be ‘ soft ' _ , where the treatment does not extend beyond the edge of the natural templateTitle[6] , or ‘ hard ' _ , where a harder form of templateTitle[3] can be used to create templateTitle[6] extensions . A full treatment including templateTitle[6] extensions is significantly more expensive than a soft templateTitle[3] polish . templateTitle[3] versus acrylic The main alternative to gel-based templateTitle[6] treatments is acrylic treatments . templateTitle[3] treatments are a relatively new invention compared to acrylic templateTitle[6] treatments , emerging in the 1980 's . Many people prefer templateTitle[3] templateTitle[6] treatments , claiming they have a more natural feeling while providing a longer-lasting , glossier finish with no chipping , peeling or cracking . However , templateTitle[3] templateTitle[6] are more complicated to apply than acrylic treatments , making acrylic templateTitle[4] and full sets cheaper than their templateTitle[3] alternatives . In addition , gels are more difficult to remove , meaning that removal often creates an additional cost – although it is possible to remove templateTitle[3] treatments at home .

This represents a steady decline from the increase after the financial crisis , but pre-recession levels were still above templateYValue[15] percent . What is templateYLabel[0] ? The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of a country refers to the share of people who want to work but can not find jobs . This includes workers who have lost jobs and are searching for new ones , workers whose jobs ended due to an economic downturn , and workers for whom there are no jobs because the labor supply in their industry is larger than the number of jobs available . Different statistics suggest which factors contribute to the overall templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] . The Kenyan context The first type , so-called `` search templateYLabel[0] '' , is hardest to see in the data . The closest proxy is templateTitle[3] 's inflation templateYLabel[1] . As workers take new jobs faster , employers are forced to increase wages , leading to higher templateYLabel[0] . Jobs lost due to economic downturns , called `` cyclical templateYLabel[0] '' , can be seen by decreases in the GDP growth templateYLabel[1] , which are not significant in templateTitle[3] . Finally , `` structural templateYLabel[0] '' refers to workers changing the industry , or even economic sector , in which they are working . In templateTitle[3] , more and more workers switch to the services sector . This is often a result of urbanization , but any structural shift in the economy 's composition can lead to this templateYLabel[0] .
This statistic gives information on the templateTitle[3] of templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of the chat-app templateTitle[0] . As of the beginning of templateTitle[9] templateTitle[10] , the Japanese chat templateTitle[1] had templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] worldwide , up from templateYValue[4] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] in April templateTitle[10] . templateTitle[0] and templateTitle[0] Game templateTitle[0] is a global chat templateTitle[1] developed for Android and iOS smartphones which has since expanded to other mobile platforms and a desktop client . Originally created during the aftermath of the Tōhoku earthquake in March 2011 , templateTitle[0] was initially developed as an internet-based communication platform that could function without the then-damaged telecommunications infrastructure in Japan . templateTitle[0] supports text and multimedia messaging and revealed a daily message volume of templateYValue[min] billion messages in early April templateTitle[10] . templateYLabel[2] can also send photos , purchase stickers similar to emoji and make free voice calls similar to Skype . templateTitle[0] 's free messaging service proved a popular alternative to text-messaging and the templateTitle[1] reached templateYValue[13] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] within 18 months of its release . Aside from the instant messaging features , templateTitle[0] has also integrated social networking elements such as templateYLabel[2] profiles as well as a personal timeline that allows templateYLabel[2] to share personal status messages with contacts in real-time . Despite being devised as a mobile messenger , templateTitle[0] has successfully transformed into a social templateTitle[1] platform with a strong social gaming presence . Since launching in July 2012 , the chat templateTitle[1] 's gaming platform templateTitle[0] Game has passed templateYValue[6] templateYLabel[4] downloads . To access templateTitle[0] Game content , templateYLabel[2] need a templateTitle[0] account . The games feature strong social components as well as in-app purchases and thus strongly contribute to the company 's revenue stream .
The global templateTitle[2] market experienced some fairly turbulent times between templateXValue[min] and templateXValue[12] , seeing templateYLabel[1] rates as high as 11.3 percent as well as lows reaching templateYValue[min] percent during that time period . However , since templateXValue[11] the situation has stabilized , and templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[1] remained on average at roughly templateYValue[6] percent . According to projections , in templateXValue[max] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] will have grown by templateYValue[0] percent . Global templateTitle[2] in templateXValue[1] Not surprisingly , the internet will be the largest templateTitle[2] medium in templateXValue[max] , accounting for a little over half of global templateTitle[2] expenditures that templateXLabel[0] . Television , which has been the undisputed favorite among advertisers , will be overtaken by digital media . Between templateXValue[4] and templateXValue[1] TV is forecast to lose close to templateYValue[2] billion U.S. dollars , while mobile internet is expected to gain 90 billion dollars in the same period . Half of major media , except for mobile internet , cinema , outdoor and radio are projected to lose investments in those three years . All in all , North America will still be the most prominent region , with the U.S. poised to hold the crown for the largest templateTitle[2] market in templateXValue[1] . Canada and Mexico will take the second and third spots within the region , but on a global scale are not predicted to rank anywhere close to the top three markets . As a matter of fact , Asian countries , China and Japan will close the top three , making Asia the second leading region in terms of templateTitle[2] expenditures .
The statistic depicts the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] in the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] from templateXValue[min] to 2050* . The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of a templateTitle[4] is an index that divides the templateTitle[4] into templateTitle[9] equal groups : half of the templateTitle[4] is older than the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] and the other half younger . In templateXValue[7] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] 's templateTitle[4] was templateYValue[7] templateYLabel[3] . templateTitle[4] of the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] The templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] ( UK ) includes Great Britain ( England , Scotland and Wales ) and Northern Ireland , and is a state located off the coast of continental Europe . The templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] is a constitutional monarchy , which means the Queen acts as representative head of state , while laws and constitutional issues are discussed and passed by a parliament . The total UK templateTitle[4] figures have been steadily increasing , albeit only slightly , over the last decade ; in 2011 , the templateTitle[4] growth rate was lower than in the previous templateXLabel[0] for the first time in eight templateYLabel[3] . Like many other countries , the UK and its economy were severely affected by the economic crisis in 2009 . Since then , the unemployment rate has doubled and is only recovering slowly . UK inhabitants tend to move to the cities to find work and better living conditions ; urbanization in the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] has been on the rise . At the same time , templateTitle[4] density in the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] has been increasing due to several factors , for example , the rising number of inhabitants and their life expectancy at birth , an increasing fertility rate , and a very low number of emigrants . In fact , the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] is now among the templateTitle[9] countries with the highest life expectancy at birth worldwide . As can be seen above , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of UK residents has also been increasing significantly since the seventies ; another indicator for a well-working economy and society .

In templateXValue[max] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] was at templateYValue[0] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] .
The statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[4] due to templateTitle[0] between templateXLabel[0] templateXValue[min] and templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[max] , templateYValue[max] people were killed by terrorists in templateTitle[4] . templateTitle[4] suffered from 1,294 terrorist attacks that templateXLabel[0] .
According to a templateTitle[9] Statista survey , templateYValue[max] percent of the U.S. templateYLabel[2] templateTitle[3] their templateTitle[1] to templateXValue[0] to templateXValue[0] . templateXValue[last] common uses of templateTitle[1] included templateXValue[1] templateXValue[1] or templateXValue[1] templateXValue[1] and listening to the templateXValue[2] . templateTitle[1] Market The retail value of global templateTitle[1] shipments was forecast to reach 26.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 , a more than threefold increase in templateYValue[min] years . templateTitle[1] templateTitle[7] shipments templateYLabel[0] projected to reach 400 million worldwide in 2019 . According to the same Statista survey , Sony is the templateTitle[1] brand that most U.S. consumers owned as of templateTitle[9] , followed by Bose and Beats by Dre , an Apple subsidiary . Hearables Hearables , or smart templateTitle[1] , templateYLabel[0] the type of wireless in-ear audio devices that , apart from providing templateXValue[5] , combine features such as active noise cancellation , fitness tracking , wireless transmission , etc . Apple , Sony and Samsung templateYLabel[0] U.S. consumers ' most preferred hearable brands as of 2019 , showcasing the tech giants ' dominance in this emerging market . True wireless hearables , such as the Apple AirPods , templateYLabel[0] also becoming more and more popular , templateXValue[5] templateTitle[7] shipments forecast to amount to 129 million in 2020 .
The statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket . This product basket contains products and services , on which the average consumer spends money throughout the templateXLabel[0] . They include expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , power , telecommunications , recreational activities and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . In templateXValue[6] , the average templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] was at templateYValue[6] percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[4] templateXLabel[0] . For comparison , templateYLabel[0] in India amounted to 9.44 percent that same templateXLabel[0] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] ( templateTitle[4] ) in the United Kingdom ( templateTitle[8] ) from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . During this period , the templateTitle[4] rose to templateYValue[max] points . With the exception of templateXValue[9] templateTitle[10] which the annual percentage change to templateTitle[4] shows as a decrease templateTitle[10] there was an increase in the templateYLabel[2] every templateXLabel[0] . The templateTitle[8] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of services shows that there was also steady growth throughout this period , although this trend was not mirrored by the templateTitle[8] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of goods whereby there was some initial fluctuation which was then followed by substantial annual increases . Fluctuation can also be found in monthly templateTitle[4] , whereby templateTitle[4] experienced a decline in each January , before gradually increasing throughout the remainder of the templateXLabel[0] . A very similar trend is found in the monthly templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] Jevons ( RPIJ ) . In addition , an templateTitle[4] inflation forecast is also accessible .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] in templateTitle[6] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is the templateYLabel[1] that divides a templateTitle[4] into templateTitle[7] numerically equal groups ; that is , half the people are younger than this templateYLabel[1] and half are older . It is a single index that summarizes the templateYLabel[1] distribution of a templateTitle[4] . In templateXValue[7] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the Brazilian templateTitle[4] was templateYValue[7] templateYLabel[3] . templateTitle[6] as a developing nation The average templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[6] 's templateTitle[4] has risen from a low of 18.2 templateYLabel[3] in templateXValue[17] to 31.2 templateYLabel[3] in templateXValue[7] , a typical change in developing nations , and other demographic parameters support this trend : As of 2014 , the share of children under 14 templateYLabel[3] of templateYLabel[1] stood at around 23.5 percent , a great improvement from earlier times . Since templateXValue[9] , the fertility rate has also dropped significantly , but now it is even lower than the natural replacement rate at 1.78 children per woman . Over the same period of time , life expectancy has also risen to 74.4 templateYLabel[3] of templateYLabel[1] - higher than the average for developing nations . These changes typically happen as a result of developing countries becoming more modernized and economically diverse . templateTitle[6] 's economy had been getting significantly stronger and per capita GDP peaked in 2011 at a much higher value than the regional average for Latin America and the Caribbean . However , the Brazilian economy has reached a difficult point , and GDP per capita is expected to fall to as low as 7,447 U.S. dollars in 2016 . As templateTitle[6] 's demographics are now similar to other developing countries , the economy has not been able to maintain a similar path to steady growth .
This statistic shows the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] of the templateTitle[3] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[max] , the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] of the templateTitle[3] amounted to approximately templateYValue[0] percent of the templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[6] templateYLabel[7] . The economic situation in templateTitle[3] Amid the political and economic crisis , templateTitle[3] 's templateTitle[0] is rising . When Russia seized and annexed Crimea in March of templateXValue[5] , pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was also ousted and the economy of templateTitle[3] took a hard hit . This resulted in sharp reductions in templateTitle[3] 's GDP , and likely caused a sharp increase in templateTitle[0] as well . Before the turmoil , Russia was templateTitle[3] 's most important import and export partner , having a significant impact on GDP after tension arose . Meanwhile , templateTitle[3] was and still is getting itself out of economic despair ; templateTitle[3] has amassed more debt with the IMF than Greece and is trying to reduce this debt by implementing hyper-austerity , which involves making cuts to public spending . Spending on templateTitle[0] and disability insurance is a part of these cuts , which is not ideal templateYLabel[7] the Ukrainian people considering that the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] is expected to reach a templateTitle[1] of 11.47 percent in templateXValue[4] . In times of increasing templateTitle[0] , a struggling economy and an inflation templateTitle[1] reaching almost 50 percent , templateXValue[4] is and will be a tough , if not desastrous templateXLabel[0] templateYLabel[7] the Ukrainian people . However , the outlook beyond templateXValue[4] is brighter and hopefully templateTitle[0] will drop beyond its peak in templateXValue[4] .
This statistic shows the results of a templateTitle[0] , conducted in templateTitle[5] among adult Americans , on whether they believe the glass is half full or half empty . templateYValue[max] percent of templateYLabel[2] said they consider themselves optimists . The templateTitle[2] and templateTitle[4] of the American people templateTitle[2] is defined as a mental attitude or worldview that favors a positive outcome , while templateTitle[4] favors a negative outcome or prediction . Depression in the United States is very common . In templateTitle[5] , around 8.7 percent of U.S. adults aged templateXValue[1] 18 and 25 reported that they had a major depression episode within the past year . Major depressive episodes in the United States templateYLabel[0] most common among American females . The number of prescription antidepressant drug use among women in the United States has increased by more than 10 percent templateXValue[1] 1988 and 2012 . Also in templateTitle[5] , about templateTitle[5] third of U.S. adults stated that they were happier than expected . The general templateTitle[2] and templateTitle[4] in a nation templateYLabel[0] often the result of its economic situation . The unemployment rate in the United States has been steadily decreasing every year since 2010 ; furthermore , it is expected to constantly decrease further until 2020 . The prospering economy and increasing gross domestic product per capita in the United States is another source of templateTitle[2] for the American people : The GDP per capita in the United States in 2014 was around 54,600 U.S. dollars . Moreover , it has been steadily increasing since 2010 . In a templateTitle[0] conducted in July 2012 , templateTitle[5] third of Americans who defined themselves as lower-class stated that they were `` not too happy '' with their current lives . On the other hand , there was a larger percentage of people whom , according to themselves , belong to the upper class that stated that they were `` very happy '' with their current lives . In addition , upper- and middle-class American adults templateYLabel[0] more optimistic about the country 's long-term economic future in comparison to lower-class American adults .
Since templateXValue[min] the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[3] for twins has risen significantly . As of templateXValue[max] the templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[3] for twins in the templateTitle[0] was templateYValue[0] templateYLabel[2] 1,000 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[1] . It is believed that an increase in the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[3] may be associated with an increased use of vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies in recent years . templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] Across the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] rates vary in a variety of ways . The templateTitle[0] states with the highest templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] rates are Connecticut and the District of Columbia . Ethnicity is another factor to be considered when investigating the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[3] . Since templateXValue[min] the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateTitle[3] has increased among all ethnicities , however , it has increased more among non-Hispanic black mothers and less among Hispanic mothers . And finally , age is another important factor in templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] rates . As of templateXValue[max] , mothers between the ages of 45 templateTitle[5] 54 had the highest templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] rates in the United States . Assisted reproductive technology Assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) is a treatment used to treat infertility among men and women . A common complication associated with ART is multiple templateYLabel[1] ( twins , triplets , etc. ) . In the templateTitle[0] , among all ART pregnancies the most common outcome was a single infant templateYLabel[1] , followed by multiple infant templateYLabel[1] . Among all templateTitle[0] ART cycles ( including those that did not lead to pregnancy ) using non-donor eggs or embryos multiple-fetus pregnancy may be present in up to six percent of cases .
The statistic shows the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] in the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[6] , the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] of the U.S. amounted to approximately templateYValue[6] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[0] . The templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] ' economy over the last decade The templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] of America is the world 's largest national economy and the second most prominent trader globally , trailing just behind China . The country is also one of the most populated countries in the world , trailing only China and India . The templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] ' economy prospers primarily due to having a plentiful amount of natural resources and advanced infrastructure to cope with the production of goods and services , as well as the templateTitle[1] and workforce to enable high productivity . Efficient productivity led to a slight growth in GDP almost every templateXLabel[0] over the past decade , despite undergoing several economic hardships towards the late 2000 's . In addition , the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] holds arguably one of the most important financial markets , with the majority of countries around the world having commercial connections with American companies . Dependency on a single market like the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] has however caused several global dilemmas , most evidently seen during the 2008 financial crisis . What initially started off as a bursting of the U.S. housing bubble lead to a worldwide recession and the necessity to reform national economics . The global financial crisis affected the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] most drastically , especially within the unemployment market as well as national debt , which continued to rise due to the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] having to borrow money in order to stimulate its economy .
This statistic shows the number of people employed in the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateTitle[4] in the templateTitle[7] templateTitle[8] ( templateTitle[10] ) from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . Once a major powerhouse of the templateTitle[10] 's economy , the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[4] was the lifeblood of several regions , providing templateTitle[0] for more than templateYValue[min] million workers . Since that time , shifting attitudes towards templateTitle[2] and the emergence of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar have seen templateTitle[2] 's role in the templateTitle[10] 's energy mix diminish in recent years . There are fewer templateTitle[2] mines in operation , and the price of templateTitle[2] has fallen , making the production and consumption of templateTitle[2] a less attractive prospect than it used to be . Each of these factors has lead to the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[4] contracting , and the loss of templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] jobs . With the exception of South and Central America , and the Asia Pacific region , most regions around the world saw a drop in templateTitle[2] consumption . North America , for example , reported a decline of templateYValue[6] percent from templateXValue[1] to templateXValue[max] . The shrinking number of jobs has not been isolated to the templateTitle[10] , with a similar reductions seen in the templateTitle[7] States .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[0] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[max] , the templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[4] templateYLabel[2] in templateTitle[0] is expected to reach templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[4] , up from four templateYLabel[4] in templateXValue[min] .

In templateXValue[max] , the templateTitle[0] VPN templateYLabel[0] is forecast to reach templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] networks are designed to extend a templateTitle[3] securely from a templateTitle[2] location , such as a business or home , across a public templateTitle[3] , as if the templateTitle[3] were directly linked . VPNs are popular among consumers for obfuscating their real location , whether to access geo-blocked services or bypass censorship or other restrictions . Among enterprises , VPNs are often set up to allow employees to access corporate intranets while travelling or working from home .
Since it was first released by developer Bluehole in March templateXValue[1] , PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds ( templateTitle[0] ) has developed a loyal legion of fans . While the battle royale game only sold templateYValue[min] templateYLabel[3] copies within the first few months of its Early Access release on Steam , this number had jumped to templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[3] units just a year later in templateXValue[0] templateXValue[0] . templateTitle[4] of the biggest games on Steam templateTitle[0] is an online multiplayer game which pits up to 100 players against each other at templateTitle[4] time . The players must scavenge for weapons and items while killing enemies and trying to survive . The map shrinks over time in order to force the remaining players into combat until only templateTitle[4] player or team is left standing .

The game is also Steam 's biggest draw in terms of hourly average number of players – templateTitle[0] averaged almost 853 thousand players per hour in templateXValue[0] , almost twice the figure of its closest competitor , DOTA templateYValue[min] . So is the game unrivalled in the battle royale genre ? templateTitle[0] 's biggest rival Not if you ask fans of Fortnite . Released by Epic Games in July templateXValue[1] , just a few months after the launch of templateTitle[0] , Fortnite is a similar battle royale survival game . While it is not available on Steam , it can be played on PC as well as on all the main consoles . Similarly to templateTitle[0] , Fortnite became an overnight sensation and latest figures have the game at a staggering 250 templateYLabel[3] registered users . The mobile version of the game has also been a commercial success , generating annual revenue of 455 templateYLabel[3] U.S. dollars in the Apple App Store alone in templateXValue[0] . Given that templateTitle[0] won the Best Multiplayer Game at The Game Awards templateXValue[1] and Fortnite won the very same award a year later , it seems that the rivalry between these games shows no signs of slowing down .
This statistic shows the degree of templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . templateTitle[0] means the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] in the templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[3] of a country . In templateXValue[max] , templateYValue[max] percent of templateTitle[2] 's templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[3] lived in templateYLabel[2] areas and cities . templateYLabel[2] areas in templateTitle[2] templateTitle[2] is currently templateTitle[3] of the most urbanized countries of East Asia , and also templateTitle[3] of the most rapidly urbanized regions around the world ; over the last ten years , the templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] in templateTitle[2] has increased from around 66 percent in 2004 to 74 percent in templateXValue[4] . This growth is expected to continue , as people from rural areas migrate to templateYLabel[2] areas due to the economy and employment continuing to shift from agriculture to industry and services . At present , the largest city in terms of templateYLabel[3] is Kuala Lumpur , which is home to around 1.31 million inhabitants - which is still relatively small , considering that the entire templateYLabel[3] of templateTitle[2] amounts to around 31 million . templateTitle[2] is also home to a number of smaller templateYLabel[2] areas , and there templateYLabel[0] three other templateYLabel[2] areas with more than 500,000 inhabitants . templateYLabel[2] areas in templateTitle[2] , notably Kuala Lumpur , templateYLabel[0] less dense than is common for templateYLabel[2] areas in East Asia . This means that dealing with and limiting sprawl will be a challenge . As the templateYLabel[2] transformation continues , there is still a chance to find a balance between templateYLabel[2] and rural settlements in an equitable , compact and sustainable manner .

In templateXValue[6] , the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] of templateTitle[3] amounted to approximately templateYValue[6] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[0] . The templateTitle[1] of templateTitle[3] templateTitle[3] is the second largest nation in the Middle East and one of the founding members of the United Nations , NAM , OIC and OPEC . With a rapidly growing templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] of just under 78 templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[0] , it is the world 's seventeenth most populous nation . templateTitle[3] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] has grown by 10 templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[0] over the past decade . In 2010 , templateTitle[3] 's templateTitle[1] grew by around 1.6 percent in comparison to the previous templateXLabel[0] , which is partially due to due the high fertility rate . In 2010 , the fertility rate of templateTitle[3] was at almost templateTitle[4] percent . Surprisingly , templateTitle[3] does not have a high life expectancy . In 2010 , the life expectancy in templateTitle[3] was just 73 years . Looking at the age structure of templateTitle[3] 's templateTitle[1] shows that the vast majority , more than 71 percent of templateTitle[3] templateYLabel[0] , were aged between 15 and 64 the same templateXLabel[0] , while only around 5.2 percent of the templateTitle[1] in templateTitle[3] were aged over 65 . Therefore , it is assumed that the growing templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] is due to an increase in the young templateTitle[1] in templateTitle[3] and immigrants . People migrating from surrounding countries , such as Afghanistan and Iraq , have increased templateTitle[3] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] drastically .
This statistic shows the average templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[6] , the average templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] had amounted to about templateYValue[6] percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[4] templateXLabel[0] . templateTitle[3] 's slowing economy The templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] has fluctuated from a low of templateYValue[14] percent in templateXValue[14] to a high of 4.39 percent as of templateXValue[10] . Despite the central bank having issued a target templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateYValue[0] percent , it was not reached in templateXValue[10] , templateXValue[9] or templateXValue[8] , defying expectations . Rising templateYLabel[0] is said to be affected by a weakening peso , combined with a relatively weak economy . While these templateYLabel[0] rates templateYLabel[2] not nearly comparable to some of the highest templateYLabel[0] rates around the world , slow growth and a lack of consumer and business confidence remain an underlying concern in templateTitle[3] . Annual economic growth remains low at around templateYValue[15] percent per templateXLabel[0] , fueling this concern . Further , export values templateYLabel[2] also in a slump as templateYLabel[2] those for imports , and this slow growth has had a significant effect on GDP growth per capita : In templateXValue[11] , GDP per capita was around 15,713 U.S. dollars per capita , and in templateXValue[8] it is expected to drop by almost a fifth . In response , this templateXLabel[0] templateTitle[3] has introduced a number of measures to help boost the economy , and templateXValue[8] is supposed to be the `` templateXLabel[0] of Productivity '' with hopes of increasing trade and investment to raise growth and wages .
In templateTitle[9] , templateXValue[0] was the templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] templateXLabel[0] in the United States , templateTitle[7] templateYLabel[0] .

This statistic shows the degree of templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . templateTitle[0] means the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] in the templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[3] of a country . In templateXValue[max] , templateYValue[max] percent of templateTitle[2] 's templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[3] lived in templateYLabel[2] areas and cities . templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] Currently , about three quarter of the templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[3] live in templateYLabel[2] areas and cities , which is more than in most nations around the world . templateTitle[0] , as it can be seen in this graph , refers to the number of people living in an templateYLabel[2] area and has nothing to do with the actual geographical size or footprint of an area or country . A country which is significantly bigger than templateTitle[2] could have a similar degree of templateTitle[0] , just because not all areas in the country templateYLabel[0] inhabitable , for example . templateTitle[3] example for this is Russia , where templateTitle[0] has reached comparable figures to templateTitle[2] , even though its geographical size is significantly bigger . However , templateTitle[2] 's level of templateTitle[0] does not make the list of the top 30 most urbanized nations in the world , where templateTitle[0] rates templateYLabel[0] higher than 83 percent . Also , while 25 percent of the templateYLabel[3] in templateTitle[2] still lives in rural areas , rural livelihoods templateYLabel[0] not dependent on agriculture , as only 0.75 percent of GDP came from the agricultural sector in templateXValue[4] . So while templateTitle[2] 's templateTitle[0] rate is growing , a significant percentage of the templateYLabel[3] is still living in rural areas . Furthermore , templateTitle[2] has a number of shrinking cities which templateYLabel[0] located to the east and in older industrial regions around the country . Considering that templateYLabel[3] growth in templateTitle[2] is on the decline , because of low fertility rates , and that a number of cities templateYLabel[0] shrinking , the templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] is likely shifting to bigger cities which have more economic opportunities than smaller ones .
This timeline shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[6] , templateTitle[3] 's average templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] amounted to templateYValue[6] percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[5] templateXLabel[0] . templateTitle[3] 's economy templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[3] has experienced an increase every templateXLabel[0] with the exception of templateXValue[15] . Some short-term increases in prices templateYLabel[2] often attributed to wars , which is a fundamental reason for yearly templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[3] . On the other hand , wars often cause spikes in GDP , primarily due to an increased amount of production and reparations . This was not the case for templateTitle[3] , however . GDP , more specifically GDP per capita , remained relatively low as of templateXValue[11] , despite increasing annually and ranked as one of the top templateTitle[4] lowest gross domestic product per capita values in templateXValue[11] . GDP per capita measures a country 's productivity by using its entire gross domestic product and dividing it by the number of people in the country and is mostly used to templateYLabel[2] one nation with another . From an economic standpoint , templateTitle[3] imported many more goods than they exported , leading to a trade deficit . The country has experienced a trade deficit every templateXLabel[0] over the past decade , most notably in templateXValue[13] . Reasons for the ongoing deficit could potentially be the lack of government support for domestic production as well as stiff rules towards marketing . Also , production and transport templateYLabel[2] likely to suffer due to the war . A trade deficit also implicates that a country borrows more money from other nations in order to sustain and fulfill the needs its economy , along with its citizens .

This statistic shows the templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the U.S. from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] with additional projections up to templateXValue[max] . The data represents U.S. city averages . The base period was 1982 templateTitle[9] 84 . In economics , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is a measurement of templateYLabel[0] , the templateYLabel[1] of increase of a price index ( in this case : consumer price index ) . It is the percentage templateYLabel[1] of change in prices level over time . The templateYLabel[1] of decrease in the purchasing power of money is approximately equal . According to the forecast , prices will increase by templateYValue[5] percent in templateXValue[5] . The templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] for previous years can be found here and the consumer price index for all urban consumers here . The monthly templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] for the templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] can also be accessed here . templateYLabel[0] in the U.S. templateYLabel[0] is a term used to describe a general rise in the price of goods and services in an economy over a given period of time . templateYLabel[0] in the templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] is calculated using the consumer price index ( CPI ) . The consumer price index is a measure of change in the price level of a preselected market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households . This forecast of U.S. templateYLabel[0] was prepared by the International Monetary Fund . They templateTitle[0] roughly a 2.25 percent templateTitle[1] rise in the general level of prices until templateXValue[max] . This means that a product bought today for about 100 U.S. dollars will cost about 102.25 U.S. dollars next templateXLabel[0] , and so on . Considering the templateTitle[1] templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the templateTitle[6] templateTitle[7] in recent years , a 2.25 percent templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] is a very moderate projection . Although the moderate templateYLabel[0] of prices between templateYValue[5] and 3 percent is considered normal in a modern economy , countries ' central banks try to prevent severe templateYLabel[0] and deflation to keep the growth of prices to a minimum . Severe templateYLabel[0] is considered dangerous to a country 's economy because it can rapidly diminish the population 's purchasing power and thus damage the GDP .
This statistic shows the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) in templateTitle[7] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . templateYLabel[0] refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per templateXLabel[0] . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . In templateXValue[6] , the templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[7] was about 2.08 trillion templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] . See global templateYLabel[0] for a global comparison . templateTitle[7] 's economy After increasing significantly year-over-year , templateTitle[7] 's templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ( templateYLabel[0] ) has gone through several fluctuations since the global economic crisis in templateXValue[16] . The European Union 's third largest economy has experienced downturns , primarily due to inefficiency with regards to spending and incompetent leadership . When analyzing the country 's budget balance , which is essentially the overall difference between revenues and spending , templateTitle[7] has posted a negative balance , or a state deficit , every templateXLabel[0] over the past decade . However , their budget balance has improved noticeably every templateXLabel[0] since templateXValue[15] . Since the country spent more than they earned , national debt continued to rise every templateXLabel[0] , most notably between templateXValue[16] and templateXValue[15] , and continued to templateYLabel[4] so going into templateXValue[10] . templateTitle[7] 's dependency on funding from other countries will lead to further debt , unless it finds a way to decrease spending or increase revenues . Despite the country 's ongoing recession , templateTitle[7] 's templateYLabel[0] ranked the country in the top 10 countries with the largest templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] in templateXValue[10] , ahead of economically developed countries such as Canada and Australia . This implies that templateTitle[7] 's economical struggles are more a result of inefficient spending rather than a lack of production .

Previously , from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[15] , the average templateYLabel[1] hovered around templateYValue[15] templateYLabel[3] . The increased average templateYLabel[1] corresponds with rising life expectancy globally , accelerating especially around the mid-twentieth century onward . In this century , the life expectancy in templateTitle[6] has increased by roughly 2.5 templateYLabel[3] since 2007 , reaching 75.5 in 2017 . The standard of living is increasing In templateTitle[6] , people ages templateTitle[7] to 64 have consistently made up the majority of the templateTitle[4] from 2007 to 2017 . In this time , the older templateTitle[4] grew increased by about three percent , while the younger templateTitle[4] shrunk at roughly the same rate . This indicates that many people within the middle templateYLabel[1] category are reaching 65 or older , and that the birth rate is simultaneously declining . Birth rates are declining Every templateXLabel[0] , families are having fewer children in templateTitle[6] , with a fertility rate of less than 1.5 children per women of childbearing templateYLabel[1] in 2017 . This is not necessarily a bad sign – it points towards increasing healthcare and living standards . Another indicator for this is the decreasing infant mortality in templateTitle[6] , meaning more of the children born each templateXLabel[0] survive . Lower infant mortality also contributes to the calculations of a higher life expectancy , and thus affects the country 's templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] .
This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of templateTitle[3] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[6] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] was around templateYValue[6] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] .

The third largest economy of the euro area not only suffered from the global financial crisis , they were also one of the primary victims of the euro area crisis . One of the outcomes is the significant growth of templateTitle[9] 's national debt , which saw continued upsurges every templateXLabel[0] over the past decade . With the collapse of investments and loss of industrial production , the Italian state was forced to resort to increase taxation and decrease spending .

The team started playing in New York in 1883 , under the name The Gothams . They changed their name to the New York templateTitle[2] shortly afterwards and again to the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] , when they relocated to California in the summer of 1957 . Before relocation , the team had already won five of its total of eight MLB ( Major League Baseball ) World Series championships as the New York templateTitle[2] . In addition to holding a number of baseball records , such as having the most Hall of Fame players in all of professional baseball , the templateTitle[2] franchise is also templateTitle[8] of the most valuable within the sport . In templateXValue[max] , Forbes estimated the total value of the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] franchise at three billion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] , which places it among the most valuable sports teams in North America . In the templateXValue[1] season , the revenue of the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] was estimated at 462 million templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . Due to the fact that templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] ' templateYLabel[1] prices , as well as game attendance , are higher than the overall MLB averages , gate receipts are responsible for a large percentage of total revenues . Based on an templateYLabel[0] regular season home attendance of almost 39 thousand spectators per game and an templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] templateYLabel[2] of over 38 templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] , the templateTitle[2] earned some 176 million templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] in gate receipts in templateXValue[1] alone . That same templateXLabel[0] , the player expenses of the templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] , including payroll , as well as benefits and bonuses , was estimated at some 219 million templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] .

This may be partly explained by the fact that due to its socialist heritage , full templateYLabel[0] policy historically has played a major role in economic considerations of the Chinese government . Another possible explanation may be found in the index 's methodology , which , according to the National Bureau of Statistics , gathers only templateYLabel[0] data for urban regions . The debate as to whether to adjust the methodology accordingly in order to create a more accurate statistical image is still ongoing among Chinese politicians and statisticians . A main concern in templateTitle[3] 's current state of templateYLabel[0] lies within the still large regional differences . As of templateXValue[8] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in more central and western regions of templateTitle[3] was notably higher than in templateTitle[3] 's eastern parts . In Beijing , templateTitle[3] 's political and cultural center , templateYLabel[0] ranged at merely 1.4 percent for templateXValue[8] . Youth templateYLabel[0] is also apparent in templateTitle[3] , but with its own characteristics . Young people with higher education are more likely to have difficulty finding a job , according to the templateTitle[3] Household Finance Survey . templateTitle[4] reason for this might lie in the enrollment expansion since 1999 . The number of newly enrolled students in public universities skyrocketed from around 2.7 million in 2001 to roughly 7.5 million in templateXValue[8] . Apart from the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] , most commonly used indicators to measure economic activities of a country are GDP growth and inflation templateYLabel[1] .

The issue is important as growing populations place higher strain on both natural and public resources including healthcare and education .

This statistic shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[6] , the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] was about 2.36 trillion templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] . Reduction of the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] and recovery of the economy in the UK The templateYLabel[1] of the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] , which amounted to around 1,600 templateYLabel[3] pounds in templateXValue[min] - more than it has ever been - is projected to keep rising . Since the economic recession of 2007 - 08 , economic growth in the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] has been slow , but it has been able to recover . In templateXValue[min] , the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] recorded a 2.8 percent growth rate . Many believe that if the economy is stable , the government will reduce spending and not accrue any more templateYLabel[1] , and it can indeed be seen that while government spending continues to increase , the gap between spending and revenue is projected to get smaller . If the government were to earn more than it spends , it could use the money left over to pay the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] and start to reduce it . However , what is even more important is the size of the templateYLabel[1] in relation to the size of the country 's economy ; if the templateYLabel[1] grows slower than the economy , the templateYLabel[1] to GDP ratio can still fall , despite a budget deficit . The ratio of government expenditure to GDP indicates that the economy is recovering at a faster rate than government expenditure , with the ratio decreasing significantly over the last decade and the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in relation to GDP being expected to decrease further as well - albeit slowly . This should help relieve concerns over the templateTitle[4] templateTitle[5] 's mounting templateYLabel[1] , but for some templateYLabel[1] reduction is just not fast enough .

The development of the world templateTitle[3] from 1950 to 2030 is estimated to be tripled according to United Nations ' data.The majority of the world templateTitle[3] lives in templateXValue[4] , but the templateTitle[3] in templateXValue[0] is forecasted to rise from 1,031 in year 2010 up to 4,185 in year 2100 . This forecast is based on the rapid templateYLabel[3] of the developing countries , such as templateXValue[0] . Developing countries are well known for its urban residents living in slum conditions . A slum is defined as a thickly populated , metropolitan area with bad living conditions and people living below the poverty line.The urban templateTitle[3] in developing countries , who lived in slums has increased steadily for the last decades .

This was the result of the steepest increase in the past ten years and was the first time templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] as a share of the templateYLabel[2] exceeded templateTitle[11] templateYLabel[0] . This share saw a continuous increase over the past decade , indicating that as the templateYLabel[2] grew , templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] grew at an even faster rate . templateTitle[8] 's templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[0] capita was over 33 thousand U.S. dollars in templateXValue[max] , increased from around 18.2 thousand dollars in templateXValue[9] , while overall medical expenses in templateXValue[max] had increased by almost ten templateYLabel[0] over the previous templateXLabel[0] , up to around 14.44 billion templateTitle[7] Korean won ( over 12 million U.S. dollars ) . Nearly 60 templateYLabel[0] of the costs were covered by the government or the public templateTitle[0] insurance system . Higher templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] is still insufficient Even though templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] as a share of the templateYLabel[2] exceeded templateTitle[11] templateYLabel[0] in templateXValue[max] , this was lower than the OECD average of 8.8 templateYLabel[0] . Likewise , the government 's templateTitle[0] expenses were around 60 templateYLabel[0] and slightly increased from the previous templateXLabel[0] , but still lower than the OECD average of almost 74 templateYLabel[0] . The increased expenditure was largely attributed to the introduction of what is dubbed `` Moon Jae-In Care '' , named after the current Korean president , much like the American Affordable Care Act is colloquially known as `` Obamacare '' . In short , the government will provide greatly expanded coverage for medical treatments and care , increasing the reimbursement rate of the public templateTitle[0] insurance , along with other measures . In addition , the Korean population as a whole is rapidly aging , and more people than before are being hospitalized and receiving examinations . Koreans already see doctors far more frequently than any other OECD nationals . Strains on templateTitle[0] templateTitle[1] and insurance The Korean national public templateTitle[0] insurance system enjoyed templateYValue[3] years of surplus revenue since templateXValue[7] but fell into the red in templateXValue[max] . As noted above , Moon Jae-In Care and the aging population are largely responsible . The years ' worth of revenue is projected to run templateTitle[7] in the coming years .
