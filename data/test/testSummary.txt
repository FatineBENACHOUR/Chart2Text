This statistic shows the degree of templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[max] . templateTitle[0] means the templateYLabel[0] of templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] in the templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[3] of a country . In templateXValue[max] , templateYValue[max] percent of templateTitle[2] 's templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[3] lived in templateYLabel[2] areas and cities . templateTitle[0] in templateTitle[2] Currently , about three quarter of the templateTitle[2] templateYLabel[3] live in templateYLabel[2] areas and cities , which is more than in most nations around the world . templateTitle[0] , as it can be seen in this graph , refers to the number of people living in an templateYLabel[2] area and has nothing to do with the actual geographical size or footprint of an area or country . A country which is significantly bigger than templateTitle[2] could have a similar degree of templateTitle[0] , just because not all areas in the country templateYLabel[0] inhabitable , for example . templateTitle[3] example for this is Russia , where templateTitle[0] has reached comparable figures to templateTitle[2] , even though its geographical size is significantly bigger . However , templateTitle[2] 's level of templateTitle[0] does not make the list of the top 30 most urbanized nations in the world , where templateTitle[0] rates templateYLabel[0] higher than 83 percent . Also , while 25 percent of the templateYLabel[3] in templateTitle[2] still lives in rural areas , rural livelihoods templateYLabel[0] not dependent on agriculture , as only 0.75 percent of GDP came from the agricultural sector in templateXValue[4] . So while templateTitle[2] 's templateTitle[0] rate is growing , a significant percentage of the templateYLabel[3] is still living in rural areas . Furthermore , templateTitle[2] has a number of shrinking cities which templateYLabel[0] located to the east and in older industrial regions around the country . Considering that templateYLabel[3] growth in templateTitle[2] is on the decline , because of low fertility rates , and that a number of cities templateYLabel[0] shrinking , the templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] is likely shifting to bigger cities which have more economic opportunities than smaller ones .
This timeline shows the templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] in templateTitle[3] from templateXValue[min] to templateXValue[6] , with projections up until templateXValue[max] . In templateXValue[6] , templateTitle[3] 's average templateYLabel[0] templateYLabel[1] amounted to templateYValue[6] percent templateYLabel[2] to the templateYLabel[5] templateXLabel[0] . templateTitle[3] 's economy templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[3] has experienced an increase every templateXLabel[0] with the exception of templateXValue[15] . Some short-term increases in prices templateYLabel[2] often attributed to wars , which is a fundamental reason for yearly templateYLabel[0] in templateTitle[3] . On the other hand , wars often cause spikes in GDP , primarily due to an increased amount of production and reparations . This was not the case for templateTitle[3] , however . GDP , more specifically GDP per capita , remained relatively low as of templateXValue[11] , despite increasing annually and ranked as one of the top templateTitle[4] lowest gross domestic product per capita values in templateXValue[11] . GDP per capita measures a country 's productivity by using its entire gross domestic product and dividing it by the number of people in the country and is mostly used to templateYLabel[2] one nation with another . From an economic standpoint , templateTitle[3] imported many more goods than they exported , leading to a trade deficit . The country has experienced a trade deficit every templateXLabel[0] over the past decade , most notably in templateXValue[13] . Reasons for the ongoing deficit could potentially be the lack of government support for domestic production as well as stiff rules towards marketing . Also , production and transport templateYLabel[2] likely to suffer due to the war . A trade deficit also implicates that a country borrows more money from other nations in order to sustain and fulfill the needs its economy , along with its citizens .
This statistic presents the templateYLabel[0] of templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[2] from templateXValue[2] templateTitle[6] to July templateTitle[8] . As of the last reported period , the note-taking and productivity app had an estimated templateYValue[max] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[2] worldwide , up from templateYValue[1] templateYLabel[4] in July 2015 .
This statistic depicts the templateTitle[0] annual templateTitle[1] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] ( templateTitle[5] ) templateTitle[8] templateXValue[min] through 2025* . In templateXValue[7] , the templateTitle[0] templateYLabel[0] templateTitle[2] templateTitle[3] ( templateTitle[5] ) stood at templateYValue[7] templateYLabel[2] templateYLabel[3] templateYLabel[4] templateYLabel[5] templateYLabel[6] .
