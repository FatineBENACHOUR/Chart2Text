Here, the average retail price of electricity was at 10.58 cents per kilowatt hour in 2018. A ranking of the largest electric utilities companies in the United States can be found here as well as a ranking of global electricity prices in select countries. Retail electricity prices in the United States When Thomas A. Edison developed a system to generate and distribute electricity in order to market his greatest creation, the electric light bulb, he would have known little about the dramatic impact his invention would create on civilization 130 years after the inauguration of the world’s first power station on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York. In 21st century America, electric power is omnipresent in peoples’ lives, as electricity is powering our factories, shops, homes - and even cars. It goes without saying that electricity consumption has to be paid for, and, naturally, people are worried about the size of their electricity bill. On average, retail electricity prices in the United States changed little from 9.90 cents per kilowatt hour in 2011 to 10.58 cents per kilowatt hour in 2017. However, while power rates in the industrial and commercial sectors increased only moderately between 2011 and 2017, residential electricity customers were charged 12.9 cents per kilowatt hour in 2016, up from 11.72 cents per kilowatt hour in 2011. The rising prices are justified by the costs of power production and power grid maintenance. Although the production cost of electricity generated from coal, natural gas and nuclear sources remained relatively flat, the integration of renewable energy sources, investments in smart grid technologies, growing peak demand and power blackouts caused by the vicissitudes of nature continued to trouble the electric utility industry in the recent past. The rates of U.S. electricity prices can also vary widely, with Hawaii residents experiencing some of the highest rates in the country.

During the same period, the number of bank branches also decreased steadily, and, as a consequence, the population size per bank branch increased from 1,734 in 2008 to 2,067 in 2016. Online banking on the rise The growing penetration of online banking, as well as the increasingly widespread use of banking apps via mobile devices also contributed to the gradual loss of importance of traditional banking and physical bank branches.

Moreover, not only customers, but also financial institutions closely follow the development of this innovative business model and look with interest and curiosity at these new players. The bank of the future? For Italians, traditional banks are still considered the preferred medium when it comes for example to loan financing and savings management. Nevertheless, digital banks and financial services providers are increasing in popularity because of more flexible, efficient and cheaper offers, which seem to be closer to the customers’ needs.

In 2018, the national debt of India amounted to about 68.05 percent of the gross domestic product. India’s economy on the rise India is one of the most populous countries in the world, and although a large share of inhabitants are living below the poverty line – or probably due to this fact –, the country’s economy is growing steadily. India’s GDP growth is expected to remain steady at more than 7 percent for the next few years, which is almost double that of the global GDP, and both GDP and GDP per capita are expected to increase significantly. Almost half of India’s workforce is employed in the agricultural sector, but services and industry share the other half quite equally. India’s GDP is mostly generated by the services sector, which includes transport, retailing, and offering services in the hospitality and tourism industry. India’s trade balance has been in the red for a decade now, but seems to recover slowly. A trade deficit usually means that a country’s import costs are higher than the amount of money generated with exporting goods. India’s imports could not be compensated for by the country’s exports, as imports have been consistently, even if only slightly, higher over the years both in terms of volume and value. Still, all signs point to India’s economy growing and thriving, reducing India’s debt (as seen above) and unemployment rate, enabling the inhabitants to create a better life for themselves.

The total number of crowdfunding platforms worldwide as of April 2012 amounted to 342, the estimated number by the end of December 2012 was at 536. The growth of crowdfunding platforms Crowdfunding or crowd sourcing is the collective effort of a number of individuals who pool together resources, usually online, in order to support the efforts of individuals or organizations wishing to get their project off the ground. After the launch of ArtistShare, the site that is often billed as being the first crowdfunding site, the growth in the number of platforms has been constant. The trends began to show in the United States towards the mid-2000s and then in Europe. The increase in the funding volume increases over the past few years are a clear sign of the developing prevalence of this method and raises some interesting questions over the true extent of its potential. In the world after the 2008 economic crisis, a world of fragile and uncertain growth and austerity, it has been proven that it is often extremely difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to procure capital loans from banks. This driver of economic growth is, at least to some extent, being helped along by those who support crowdfunding campaigns online.

 In 2018, California had the highest number of forcible rape cases in the United States, with 15,505 reported rapes. Vermont had the lowest number of reported forcible rape cases at 243. Number vs. rate It is perhaps unsurprising that California had the highest number of reported rapes in the United States in 2018, as California is the state with the highest population. When looking at the rape rate, or the number of rapes per 100,000 of the population, a very different picture is painted: Alaska was the state with the highest rape rate in the country in 2017, with California ranking as 35th in the nation. The prevalence of rape Rape and sexual assault are notorious for being underreported crimes, which means that the prevalence of sex crimes is likely much higher than what is reported. Additionally, more than a third of women worry about being sexually assaulted, and most sexual assaults are perpetrated by someone the victim knew.

US nuclear refueling outage days America’s electricity needs are met by a selection of energy carriers including coal, oil and natural gas, as well as nuclear fuel and renewable energy sources. Despite the wide variety of fuels that can be used, the country’s power generation structure consists primarily of coal and nuclear power to provide its citizens with an around-the-clock “baseload” supply of electricity – this is what makes nuclear power an essential and crucial element of the U.S. power generation mix. In spring and fall, when demand for electricity is lowest, a limited number of nuclear reactors are shut down for refueling and maintenance. Since spent fuel rods are no longer useful in sustaining a nuclear reaction, nuclear units are required to dispose of some of the spent fuel rods and conduct other routine maintenance and repair activities. The level of outage days at operational nuclear power plants in the United States dramatically decreased in the 1990s, when plants reduced the number of refueling outage days from 81 in 1997 to 40 in 1999. In 2018, there were 34 refueling outage days at U.S. nuclear power plants, down from 46 in 2012.

 This statistic displays the number of murders in the United States by state. Data includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. In 2018, the number of murders in California amounted to 1,739 victims. Murder in the United States Violent crime statistics, particularly murder and homicide data, provide key insights into law enforcement in the United States and inform national debate surrounding crime policies. There were a total of 16,214 reported murder and non-negligent manslaughter cases in the U.S. in 2018. Although the number of cases has declined in the past twenty years, when viewed in international comparison, the U.S. murder rate is still high. In 2012, Germany’s murder rate stood at 0.8, compared to 4.7 in the United States. The most dangerous U.S. state in 2018, if measured by the number of murders per hundred thousand inhabitants, was Louisiana. The murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate in Louisiana came to 11.4 that year, more than twice the national average. The least dangerous state in 2018, on the other hand, was South Dakota, with a murder rate of 1.4. Murder, homicide and violent crime statistics regularly influence America’s current political debate on gun law.

The amount of firearms in circulation in the U.S. is fairly high, when compared with European countries. About 43 percent of American households have a gun in their home. Though any causal connection between firearm circulation and homicide rate is purely speculative, murder by firearm is nonetheless high. About 63 percent of murders and non-negligent manslaughter cases in the U.S. were carried out using a firearm, including handguns, rifles, and shotguns. This number sums up to 10,265 murders by firearm. The ranking of the most dangerous cities in the world based on murder rate per capita can be accessed here. 
 The statistic shows GDP per capita in the United Kingdom from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, GDP per capita in the United Kingdom was at around 42,579.82 US dollars. The same year, the total UK population amounted to about 64.6 million people. The United Kingdom is among the leading countries in a world GDP ranking.Falling unemployment in a time of recession GDP is a useful indicator when it comes to measuring the state of a nation’s economy. GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a year. GDP per capita equals exactly the GDI (gross domestic income) per capita and is not a measure of an individual’s personal income. As can be seen clearly in the statistic, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the United Kingdom is beginning to increase, albeit not to pre-recession levels. The UK is beginning to see signs of an economic recovery, though as of yet it remains unclear what sort of recovery this is. Questions have been raised as to whether the growth being seen is the right sort of growth for a well balanced recovery across the necessary sectors. An interesting oddity occurred in the United Kingdom for nine months in 2012, which saw a decreasing unemployment occurring at the same time as dip in nationwide economic productivity. This seems like good - if not unusual - news, but could be indicative of people entering part-time employment. It could also suggest that labor productivity is falling, meaning that the UK would be less competitive as a nation. The figures continue to rise, however, with an increase in employment in the private sector. With the rate of inflation in the UK impacting everyone’s daily lives, it is becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable groups to maintain a decent standard of living.

 As of March 2, 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had been confirmed in 65 countries, with the overwhelming majority of cases reported in China. The virus had infected 88,948 people worldwide, and the number of deaths had totaled 3,043. The most severely affected countries outside of China were the Republic of Korea and Italy. COVID-19: background information COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that had not previously been identified in humans. The first case was detected in the Hubei province of China on December 31, 2019, and was linked to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Thousands of new cases are being reported each day, and because the illness has only recently been detected, it is not known exactly how the virus spreads from person to person. Naming the coronavirus disease Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can be transmitted between animals and people, causing illnesses that may range from the common cold to more severe respiratory syndromes. In February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization announced official names for both the virus and the disease it caused: SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, respectively. The name of the disease is derived from the words corona, virus, and disease, while the number 19 represents the year that it emerged.

 The statistic shows the total population of South Korea from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the total population of South Korea was about 51.64 million people. Population of South Korea South Korea, also called Republic of Korea, has one of the highest population densities worldwide, i.e. a very high number of inhabitants per square kilometer. However, this does not equal bad standard of living; on the Human Development Index, which ranks countries by their level of living standards using key factors, such as unemployment rate, literacy rate, fertility and mortality rates, etc., South Korea is among the highest-ranked countries. When looking at the aforementioned key factors, South Korea indeed seems to offer a fairly stable environment for its inhabitants, economically and demographically: The country’s unemployment rate has been relatively steady for the past decade, its gross domestic product (GDP) is constantly increasing, and it is among the countries with the highest trade surplus worldwide. As for standard of living, life expectancy at birth in South Korea is among the highest worldwide – South Korea is even mentioned in a recent ranking of the best birthplaces for children. Despite the high population density, South Korea is now one of the countries with the lowest fertility rates, i.e. the number of babies born by women of childbearing age. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by a high number of immigrants coupled with the aforementioned high life expectancy.

 Household waste volumes per person in England remained at a similar level between 2010 and 2017. Although there was an overall decrease during this period, the household volumes were still over 400 kilograms per person in 2017. The region which generated the largest volume of residual waste per household was the North East of England, where an average of 601 kilograms of waste was generated per person in 2017/2018. Recycling rates slowing down From 2000/2001 to 2011/2012, the recycling rates of household waste in England increased steadily from just 11.2 percent to 43 percent. However, since then there has been no noticeable increase in recycling rates. In fact, in 2015/2016, recycling rates dropped slightly to levels last seen in 2011/2012. In 2019, the UK Government set out plans to overhaul the waste system. One proposal to improve household recycling levels was to introduce more consistent sets of recyclable materials, such as separate food waste collection. Food waste Food waste is a growing concern worldwide, with an estimated 1.6 billion metric tons going to waste each year. This is approximately one third of the total food produced globally. In 2017, 75 kilograms of food per capita was wasted in the UK. In comparison, Italy, which has a similar population size to the UK generated 145 kilograms of food waste per capita.

 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Nicaragua from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Nicaragua amounted to about 4.97 percent compared to the previous year. Nicaragua's economy Nicaragua’s inflation rate has been on the decline since 2011, but it is expected to rise again in 2016. In 2011, the country's economy experienced higher than average annual growth, which most likely helped increase consumer confidence and may have correlated with a decrease in the inflation rate. In general, consumer confidence is rising because GDP per capita has also been increasing steadily and is expected to continue to do so in the future. However, living conditions of Nicaraguans are still far from ideal, and the country struggles to overcome its reputation as one of the poorest nations in the region. GDP per capita in Nicaragua remained under 2,000 U.S. dollars per capita in 2014; only a fraction of GDP for Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole, which was slightly over 10,000 U.S. dollars per capita that same year. Yet, while per capita GDP is low, the country reports average unemployment and typically, when unemployment is low, consumer confidence increases and prices rise. However, it is likely that any increase in inflation will still have a significant effect on the poor, even if GDP rises.

How many pubs are there in the UK? There were approximately 47,600 pubs operating in the United Kingdom in 2018. This represented a decrease of approximately 7,200 pubs in the last ten years, and over 13,200 pubs since 2000. Pubs in decline Several factors have been suggested for the decline in pubs in the UK. Public houses, once considered an important pillar of British communities, have faced several challenges related to changing consumer behavior. The 2007 indoor smoking ban and rising alcohol prices deterred people from drinking in pubs, sparking a trend in ‘pre-loading’ on cheap supermarket-bought alcohol before going out. Socializing at home has also become more common place thanks to developments in technology and home entertainment. Not to mention younger generations are drinking less, with more 16-24-year olds choosing to not drink alcohol at all. New trends continue to attract pub goers Although many businesses have succumbed to closure, the nation’s pub culture is still thriving, albeit in different ways. The popularity of pubs for eating out has resulted in many businesses increasing their food offering and taking advantage of new drinking trends such as craft and non-alcoholic beers. Independent pubs, although having a seemingly higher risk of closure, have in fact increased in number: there were around 4,550 more independently owned pubs in the UK in 2017 than ten years earlier. This may be due in part to the emergence of micro-breweries, and consumers becoming more sophisticated in their tastes, preferring to visit traditional pubs or other independents which cater to more sophisticated tastes than the larger pub chains. Independently owned pubs still make up the largest proportion of pubs in the UK, the rest being managed, tenanted or leased by a brewer or pub company.
