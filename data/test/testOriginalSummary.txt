This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Germany from 2008 to 2018 . Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country . In 2018 , 77.31 percent of Germany 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . Urbanization in Germany Currently , about three quarter of the German population live in urban areas and cities , which is more than in most nations around the world . Urbanization , as it can be seen in this graph , refers to the number of people living in an urban area and has nothing to do with the actual geographical size or footprint of an area or country . A country which is significantly bigger than Germany could have a similar degree of urbanization , just because not all areas in the country are inhabitable , for example . One example for this is Russia , where urbanization has reached comparable figures to Germany , even though its geographical size is significantly bigger . However , Germany 's level of urbanization does not make the list of the top 30 most urbanized nations in the world , where urbanization rates are higher than 83 percent . Also , while 25 percent of the population in Germany still lives in rural areas , rural livelihoods are not dependent on agriculture , as only 0.75 percent of GDP came from the agricultural sector in 2014 . So while Germany 's urbanization rate is growing , a significant percentage of the population is still living in rural areas . Furthermore , Germany has a number of shrinking cities which are located to the east and in older industrial regions around the country . Considering that population growth in Germany is on the decline , because of low fertility rates , and that a number of cities are shrinking , the urban population is likely shifting to bigger cities which have more economic opportunities than smaller ones .
This timeline shows the inflation rate in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , Afghanistan 's average inflation rate amounted to 0.63 percent compared to the previous year . Afghanistan 's economy Inflation in Afghanistan has experienced an increase every year with the exception of 2009 . Some short-term increases in prices are often attributed to wars , which is a fundamental reason for yearly inflation in Afghanistan . On the other hand , wars often cause spikes in GDP , primarily due to an increased amount of production and reparations . This was not the case for Afghanistan , however . GDP , more specifically GDP per capita , remained relatively low as of 2013 , despite increasing annually and ranked as one of the top 20 lowest gross domestic product per capita values in 2013 . GDP per capita measures a country 's productivity by using its entire gross domestic product and dividing it by the number of people in the country and is mostly used to compare one nation with another . From an economic standpoint , Afghanistan imported many more goods than they exported , leading to a trade deficit . The country has experienced a trade deficit every year over the past decade , most notably in 2011 . Reasons for the ongoing deficit could potentially be the lack of government support for domestic production as well as stiff rules towards marketing . Also , production and transport are likely to suffer due to the war . A trade deficit also implicates that a country borrows more money from other nations in order to sustain and fulfill the needs its economy , along with its citizens .
