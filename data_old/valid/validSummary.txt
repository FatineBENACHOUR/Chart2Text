The music streaming service operates under the freemium business model, with basic services being free and additional features such as offline mobile support and ad-free listening offered via paid subscriptions. Spotify generates the majority of its revenues via subscriptions – in 2015, subscription revenues amounted to 1.74 billion euros, representing a 78 percent growth from the previous year.

In 2015, digital music accounted for 6.7 billion U.S. dollars of recorded music market revenues worldwide, surpassing traditional music sales and arguably reviving music sales overall. Nonetheless, streaming experts find that the compensation of artists via digital royalty fees is still lacking when compared with streaming platform revenues and the number of streams.

Living the American Dream Ever since the opening of the West in the United States, California has represented the American Dream for both Americans and immigrants to the U.S. The warm weather, appeal of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, and cities that stick in the imagination such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, help to encourage people to move to California.

By 2040, the population of California is expected to increase by almost 10 million residents, which goes to show that its appeal, both in reality and the imagination, is going nowhere fast.

 In 2018, there were approximately 1.2 million insurance agents, brokers and service employees in the United States. The insurance industry and employment The number of the U.S. insurance brokers, agents and service employees has remained relatively stable during the difficult period that followed the recession of 2008 and the period of financial insecurity that ensued, and, to some extent, remains to this day. This is consistent with the general acceptance of the fact that the insurance industry is fairly recession-proof. Insurance companies tend to be conservative in a fiscal sense, and regardless of what the economy is doing, people need insurance. A further benefit which allows insurance companies a relatively high level of independence is the fact that they are generally mutual insurance companies, which answer to policy holders rather than to Wall Street. This is not to say, however, that the industry is immune to the effects of the economic situation around it. If gas prices rise, for example, consumers may decide not to buy the second car they had been thinking about, or the house extension they had been planning. This, in turn, means fewer policies sold by the insurance companies. At the same time, crime levels generally tend to rise in a period of recession, meaning higher claims made and higher payouts made by the insurance company. The economic situation and the insurance industry are reliant on one another and both require each other in one way or another for prosperity and stability. People may not think of the insurance industry as the most glamorous opportunity for employment, but employment levels have been steadily rising in the industry.

However, the future looks better - GDP per capita is expected to increase at a higher rate than previously due to strong economic growth that is projected. Low inflation will also help. The country is expected to experience growth rates in the range of 3 to 5 percent each year. This growth is a result of a diversified economy and a push towards advancing the industrial sector.

GDP growth in Morocco has also benefitted from the drop in oil prices, as it is import-dependent regarding its energy supply. However, Morocco must prepare itself for when prices rise to previous levels again. However, overall, the outlook for Morocco is bright, but it will need to focus on competitiveness and productivity.

 Dutch households had nearly 715 billion euros of outstanding mortgage loans at the end of 2018, a significant value when compared to earlier years. Despite its relatively small population size, the Netherlands had a much higher mortgage debt than most other European countries and was not far from those found in the United Kingdom, France or Germany. This has a political background as the Dutch government for many years wanted to help people to buy a house. The tax system allowed homeowners to deduct interests paid on mortgage from pre-tax income for a maximum period of thirty years. This was known as hypotheekrenteaftrek, and consequently lead to the Netherlands becoming the European country with the highest share of the population who is an owner-occupier with a mortgage. Since 2014, the Dutch government is slowly scaling this tax facility down, with an acceleration planned from 2020 onwards. What are the biggest companies in the Dutch mortgage market? Banks ABN AMRO, Rabobank and ING provided more than half of mortgages in the Netherlands in 2019. Another 11 percent of the market was provided by banks outside the traditional top three.

Banks, insurance companies, regiepartijen (funds that originate mortgage loans on behalf of institutional investors, no English word exists for this term) and other providers do not have to share this information openly. Housing in the Netherlands and the risk of water As many people in the Netherlands both own a house and have a mortgage as well, a big theme is the risk of a house going underwater or negative home equity.

For this risk alone, one can find much data on residential property in the Netherlands. For example, quarterly pulse monitors state that housing prices in the Netherlands are set to increase but decelerate in 2020.

GDP per capita is the breakdown of GDP to the country’s total population, showing how much each of the inhabitants have theoretically obtained. GDP per capita is a popular measure of the standard of living, prosperity, and overall well-being in a country. A high GDP per capita indicates a high standard of living, a low one indicates that a country is struggling to supply its inhabitants with everything they need. GDP per capita in South Sudan South Sudan’s 13 million inhabitants have been struggling with severe poverty, high death rates, civil wars, and violence for years now, and their standard of living is respectively low. Today, the country relies heavily on agriculture with the majority living in rural areas, but violence, the lack of food, and inefficient water supply often cause famine and illnesses. Since South Sudan thus cannot produce and export goods efficiently and sufficiently, GDP per capita does not even reach four-figure levels, despite a quite low number of inhabitants. NGOs and government agencies are trying to improve their situation by offering funding and education, but significant improvement has yet to be seen.

 The crime rate in Germany for 2018 was 6,710 crimes per 100 thousand people, making it the third year in a row that the crime rate has fallen in the country. Between 2000 and 2004 the crime rate in Germany increased from 7,625 to 8,037, before declining to 7,253 by 2010. The years between 2010 and 2015 saw an increase in the crime rate, but after 2015, the recent trend of declining crime started, leading to the generally low figures seen in the most recent years. Overall crime falls The overall number of crime offences recorded by the police in Germany in 2018 was approximately 5.55 million, compared with 5.76 in 2017. During the time period between 2000 and 2018, the year with the most recorded crime offences was 2004 when there were over 6.63 million crimes in the country. Despite the recent reductions in overall crime, there was a sharp increase in the number of murders committed in Germany, with the 901 murders recorded in 2018 the highest since the year 2000, when there were 930. Crime rate highest in cities Germany’s sixteen states are made up of thirteen federal states, and three city states; Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen.

The large federal state of Bavaria, in the southeast of Germany, had the lowest crime rate in the country at 4889 crimes per 100 thousand people. 
 The statistic shows the inflation rate in Japan from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket. This product basket contains products and services, on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. In 2018, the inflation rate in Japan was about 0.98 percent compared to the previous year. Economy of Japan Among the countries with the largest gross domestic product / GDP, Japan is only outranked by the United States and China, making it the third-largest economy in the world. Apart from a few significant slumps in growth now and then, Japan’s gross domestic product has been stable for the past decade, and is mostly yielded by the services sector. Industry accounts for about 30 percent of Japan’s GDP; while a smaller contribution of 1.3 percent is generated by the agricultural sector. This is reflected in the economic sector distribution of the workforce in Japan; the majority of Japan’s workers are employed in services. Japan’s inflation rate, which can be seen above, is actually among the lowest worldwide. The country’s national debt in relation to GDP has reached dramatic levels over the years, and the budget balance in Japan in relation to gross domestic product / GDP has ran at a deficit at about 10 percent of GDP for the past few years. As for trade, Japan is among the leading export countries worldwide, and the leading import countries worldwide. Japan’s main export and import partners are China and the United States. Among other goods, the country exports mainly electronics, transportation equipment and vehicles, while imports mostly consist of fossil fuels, food and textiles. This, however, does not mean that Japan's economy is recovering anytime soon - its trade balance has been showing a steadily increasing deficit for the past few years as well.

 This statistic shows the moral stance of Americans regarding sexual intercourse between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman as of 2018. During the survey, 69 percent of respondents stated that they think sex between unmarried partners is morally acceptable. The moral acceptance of social issues in the US More than two thirds of respondents to a survey in the United States responded that they believe that sex between an unmarried man and woman is morally acceptable, while one third believed that it is morally wrong and only 1 percent stated that it is not a moral issue. Unsurprisingly, when posing the same question to respondents of the Mormon faith, a significantly higher percentage stated they believed that premarital sex is morally wrong. Regarding other morally acceptable or unacceptable actions, divorce had an acceptance rate of 71 percent among the American population, and the use of birth control was deemed acceptable – remarkably higher than the acceptance rates for premarital sex. In the United States, the likelihood of divorce after the first marriage is at about 41 percent, and proportionally higher the more times one gets hitched; and it is increasingly more accepted than it has been in the past. Interestingly, the 2015 results for premarital sex acceptance in the United States are quite different from the results of a similar survey back in 2013, conducted globally, in which 36 percent of respondents in the United States said that premarital sex is not a moral issue, only 29 percent responded that it was acceptable and 30 percent stated it was unacceptable. The country with the least acceptance was Pakistan, where no one responded that premarital sex was acceptable. This is not surprising when taking into account that Pakistan is an Islamic Republic. In contrast, the Czech Republic had the highest acceptance rates, a country with one of the largest atheist populations worldwide.

 In 2018, the annual per capita disposable income of urban households in China amounted to approximately 39,251 yuan. Annual per capita income in Chinese urban areas saw a significant rise over the last decades and is still rising at a high pace. During the last nine years, per capita disposable income nearly doubled in China. Income distribution in China – additional information As an emerging economy, China faces a large number of development challenges, one of the most pressing issues being income inequality. The growing income gap between rural and urban areas has been stirring social unrest in China and poses a serious threat to the dogma of a “harmonious society” proclaimed by the communist party. In contrast to the disposable income of urban households, that of rural households only amounted to less than 15,000 yuan in 2018. Coinciding with the urban-rural income gap, income disparities between coastal and western regions in China have become apparent. As of 2018, households in Shanghai and Beijing displayed the highest average annual income of about 68,000 yuan both, followed by Zhejiang province with 55,600 yuan. Heilongjiang, a province located in the Northeast of China, had the lowest average annual household income in China with merely 29,200 yuan. Income inequality in China - the Gini coefficient The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure of income inequality. For China, the official Gini coefficient also indicates the astonishing inequality of income distribution in the country. Although the Gini coefficient has dropped from its high in 2008 at 49.1 points, it still ranged at a score of 46.8 points in 2018 and has been moderately raising since 2015. The United Nations have set an index value of 40 as a warning level for serious inequality in a society.

 General Motors generated some 137 billion U.S. dollars in revenue during the 2019 fiscal year, a drop of 6.7 percent year-on-year. Revenue from GM's automotive segments contracted by eight percent overall and 16 percent in markets outside North America. Investments, unions, and weak demand in Asia Automotive revenue suffered due to various factors, including a labor union strike in the U.S., stalling vehicle sales, and high investments targeted at autonomous driving. Despite revenue of 100 million U.S. dollars, losses at GM's Cruise subsidiary soared to more than one billion U.S. dollars in 2019. As a result, GM's EBIT margin dropped 1.9 points to 6.1 percent.

 In South Korea in 2017, there were approximately 2.34 doctors for every 1,000 Koreans. This was a slight increase compared to the preceding year, and this ratio has increased steadily since 2000, exception for a slight drop in 2004. However, Korea still has few doctors relative to its population. The OECD average was 3.3 doctors per 1,000 people, and among the full OECD member countries, only Turkey had a lower ratio of 1.9. According to OECD data, only Turkey and the accession candidate Colombia and the key partners, the People's Republic of China, South Africa, and India have ratios lower than Korea's. At the other end of the spectrum is Austria with 5.2 doctors per 1,000 people, followed by Norway with 4.8 and Lithuania with 4.6. Shortage of medical staffs The Korean government officially declared a shortage of several thousand doctors across the nation and recommended the training of an additional 150 doctors every year to make up the shortfall. Furthermore, doctors of traditional Korean medicine are counted among the number of doctors, meaning there are even fewer doctors of modern medical sciences than the official figures suggest. Yet several factors, such as resistance from doctors, prevent the government from simply increasing the number of medical graduates. Regional imbalances in the medical environment Some experts refute the government’s claims that Korea faces a doctor shortage and point towards other factors. For example, Korea has a higher population density than other countries, meaning that the average Korean doctor meets with more patients than an Austrian or Norwegian would, for example. Indeed, half the population is concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area and Koreans see doctors over 20 times a year on average, which is far more frequently than any other OECD nationals. Despite this, Korea spends a lower share of its GDP on medical expenditures than other OECD countries, implying that medical personnel do more work for less financial compensation. Regional disparities where doctors are concentrated in Seoul and other major cities is also an issue. The doctor-to-people ratio in Seoul is higher than the national ratio and the same as the OECD average. Many argue that a shortage of nurses, not because too few are being trained but because many leave because of harsh working conditions, is a greater concern than an alleged shortage of doctors.

 The inflation rate in Germany was 1.93 percent in 2018, expected to reach 2.13 percent by 2024. The current rate meets the European Central Bank’s target rate, which is “below, but close to, 2 percent.” Many central bankers favor inflation between 2 and 3 percent, but Germans in particular would rather risk deflation than too much inflation. Causes of inflation Central bankers like low, stable inflation because this is a sign of a growing economy. When the economy grows, workers become more productive and spend more, and prices slowly rise. Monetary policy can cause inflation, but Germany has given this responsibility to the European Central Bank (ECB). Importantly, inflation expectations affect inflation, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. The German context During the eurozone crisis, German politicians were advocating for the ECB to raise interest rates quickly. This would have reduced inflation, possibly causing deflation, but would have presented another hurdle for the struggling Greek economy. This is because of the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, when Germans carried their pay home in wheelbarrows because the banknotes had lost so much value. Ever since, Germans often warn that inflation harms pensioners and that personal provisions are necessary in any case.

 This statistic shows the total population of Spain from 2010 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the total population of Spain was around 46.45 million people. Population of Spain While Spain’s fertility rate has been relatively steady over the past decade, its year-over-year population growth has been declining continuously at the same time. A very noticeable plunge was observed from 2008 to 2009, when population growth was almost halved. Reasons for this decline are manifold, it is speculated that is was caused by the economic crisis taking place simultaneously. The collapse of the job and real estate markets may have led the Spanish to postpone having (more) kids or to migrate to other countries in search of a more stable economy. This theory is supported by data on the average age of Spain’s inhabitants; a look at the median age of Spain’s population from 1950 up until today shows that the Spanish get older on average – perhaps due to the aforementioned factors. Speaking of Spain’s economy, economic key factors suggest that the country is still recovering from the crisis. Its gross domestic product (GDP) was in admirable shape prior to the collapse, but it still has not returned to its former glory. Only recently has Spain reported actual GDP growth since 2008, it remains to be seen if this is going to translate into a positive trend over the next few years. This in turn could mean that the country’s unemployment rate is slowly but surely decreasing again after peaking at an alarming 25 percent in 2013.

Brazil has undergone a huge economic transformation in the course of the last decade and is now one of the fastest growing economies on the planet. It belongs to the BRIC club of countries, an acronym that refers to the countries Brazil, Russia, India and China, a group of countries which are considered to be at a relatively similar stage of new and advancing economic development. Economic reforms in Brazil have given the country a boost on the international stage, which has helped it to gain significantly in recognition and influence around the world. The domestic product growth rate in Brazil is progressing throughout the years. After a minor blip in 2009, when a short recession saw the rate of growth moving slightly backwards, the economy has picked itself up and fought back with an increase of an impressive 7.53 percent in 2010. Despite the rapid growth and the perceived increase in Brazilian domestic prosperity, the gap between rich and poor remains distinct. The lower class manifested themselves in the numerous protests that erupted across the South American state in the summer of 2013. For days, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to protest the increase of public transport fares, but the demonstrations evolved into a more general protest against increasing social inequalities among the Brazilian population, despite increased prosperity.

 The statistic shows the twenty countries with the highest public debt in relation to GDP in 2019. In 2019, Japan ranked first among the countries with the highest public debt levels; it had an estimated debt of around 237.69 percent of GDP.Japanese public debt Public debt, also known as national and government debt, is the debt owed by a nation’s central government. However, as a government draws in much of its income from its population, government debt is an indirect debt on taxpayers. The countries with the highest public debt are unsurprising, and although the United States' debt is much vaster; no nation in the world has a higher public debt in relation to GDP than Japan. The nation’s soaring debt is at around a quadrillion yen, roughly 10.5 trillion US dollars, and larger than the German, French and British economies combined. The Japanese government is currently spending around half of its total tax revenue on servicing its massive debt. Despite this, the yield on 10-year Japanese bonds remains at a surprisingly low level at under 1 percent. The Japanese have limited options available to them. A possibility could be to default on their debt; this would probably result in a renegotiation of the interest rate and the length of the loan of the principal payments. At present, however, Japan has decided to try and inflate its debt away and have begun to implement the greatest QE experiment attempted by any nation. The Bank of Japan plans to print money to the value of around 60 trillion yen and use it to buy government bonds. The Japanese government is counting on investors to buy up its bonds, despite the fact that the nation plans to almost double its monetary base, effectively halving the purchasing power. For the moment, it seems to be working, but a change in attitudes on the part of the buyers and an increase in interest rates could have catastrophic repercussions for Japan.

 One of the first mass recycling programs in the United States was implemented in 1970 in Hawaii. Since then, the recovery of municipal solid waste (MSW) for recycling has increased, reaching 67.2 million tons in 2017. U.S. recycling since China’s plastic import ban China was once the largest purchaser of plastic imports from the United States, but in 2017, China implemented a ban on the import of most plastic waste, with the exception of only the highest quality plastics. Instead, countries like Vietnam, Turkey, and Malaysia have taken on the burden of plastic waste. Much of the previously exported plastic waste must now be dealt with domestically, and many municipalities are struggling, finding that many plastic products cannot be recycled. Since the ban, many cities have been unable to keep up with the volume of recycled goods, and hundreds of local recycling programs have collapsed. Single stream recycling In the United States, single stream recycling is commonly used by material recovery facilities (MRFs). This system allows many different types of recyclables, including paper, plastic, metal, and glass to be placed into one container and is then collected and sorted within the MRF. Single stream recycling tends to increase recycling rates due to its ease, encouraging consumers to recycle. However, allowing consumers to put all materials into one waste bin increases contamination such as broken glass or presence of non-recyclable items. Single stream recycling tends to decrease the quality of materials recovered.

The labor force is made up of the people who are old enough and physically fit enough to work. The unemployment rate is an important economic factor, but economists do not always agree on what exactly causes unemployment. They do agree, however, that unemployment typically rises during bad times for the economy, i.e. recessions. As for other important economic factors, Russia’s inflation rate has been decreasing for a few years now, while its real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product is still recovering from a steep decline in 2009. As most other economies, Russia’s economy focuses mostly on the Services and Industry sector, while the Agriculture sector plays little to no role when it comes to gross domestic product generation. Consequently, the vast majority of the labor force works in those two sectors. However, Russia is among the top wheat exporters worldwide, ranking third after the United States and Canada.

Lung transplants carried out in the UK In the year to March 2019, 164 lung transplants were carried out in the United Kingdom as a whole. This represented a 20 percent increase on the number of transplants from the previous year. The majority of these (138), were carried out in England. A further fourteen in Scotland were performed, the second highest in the UK. Comparisons with Europe The UK has a low rate of lung transplant procedures compared to other European nations at three lung transplants per million population. This is much lower than the rate in Austria which was at 13.3 per million population. The rate in the UK in 2017 only ranks above Hungary, Poland and Lithuania. 
 The statistic shows the estimated total population of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 2014 to 2024. In 2018, approximately 10.43 million inhabitants were estimated to live in the UAE. Population of the United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates (UAE) have undergone extreme demographic changes over the past decade. With the increasing developments, tourism and global recognition of cities in the UAE like Abu Dhabi and Dubai, it is to no surprise that the total population has grown by about 6 million people over the past decade. However, the majority of the total population of the UAE are expatriates. Any expatriate having lived in the UAE for a minimum of 20 years can apply for a citizenship, consequently, the growing total population is mainly due to the growing number of expatriates who become citizens and the high number of immigrants which gives the UAE the world’s highest net migration rate. This becomes evident when looking at the fertility rate, the average rate of children born per fertile woman in a year in the UAE, which has been steadily declining over the last decade. Life expectancy, however, has been increasing steadily over the same time span. It is interesting to note that, despite this increase, total population of the UAE consists mainly of people between the ages of 15 to 64, another fact pointing towards expatriates and immigrants contributing to the increasing numbers.

It is thought to have originated in China, with records of its use dating back to the 3rd century AD. Originally used as a medicinal beverage, the drink was popularized for recreational use during the Tang dynasty and spread to other Asian countries. After European traders brought the leaves back to Europe in the 16th century its popularity spread in the West as well. Production Today, China is still the leader in tea production. The country produced over 2.5 million metric tons of it in 2017. Other large producers are India and Kenya. These regions are hospitable to Camellia sinensis, the plant used to produce tea, which needs a tropical or subtropical climate. Consumption While Pakistan is the biggest importer of tea worldwide, buying over a half billion dollars’ worth in 2017, it is the citizens of Turkey who are most fond of the beverage.

 This graph shows the number of people per household in the U.S. from 1960 to 2019. The average American household consisted of 2.52 people in 2019. Households in the U.S. As shown in the statistic, the number of people per household has decreased over the past decades. The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as follows: “a household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of residence. A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.).” The population of the United States has been growing steadily for decades. Since 1960, the number of households more than doubled from 53 million to about 128 million households in 2018. Most of these households, about 34 percent, are two-person households. The distribution of U.S. households has changed over the years though. The percentage of single-person households has been on the rise since 1970 and made up the second largest proportion of households in the U.S. in 2019, at 28 percent. In concordance with the rise of single-person households, the percentage of family households with own children living in the household has declined since 1970 from 56 percent to 40 percent in 2019. 
 This statistic shows the number of iPod units sold worldwide by Apple from 2006 to 2014 (according to the company's fiscal year). Sales have been decreasing in recent years after peaking at 54.83 million in 2008. Global Apple iPod sales – additional information The first line of iPods was introduced to the market in 2001, Apple’s first foray into consumer electronics. Two years later, Apple launched the iTunes Music Store. The iPod, along with iTunes, revolutionized the music industry by offering a smooth combination of software and hardware in a pocket-sized device. With several hundred million units sold over the years, the iPod can be considered one of the company’s biggest successes. iPod sales peaked at four billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 2008. In all of 2008, a total of 54.83 million iPods were sold. With the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and its rapid success, the share of the company's total revenue generated from iPod sales started to decrease. Up until the third quarter of 2010 though, Apple still sold more iPods than iPhones. In the last quarter of 2014, iPod sales accounted for about one percent of Apple's total revenue. At that point, iPhone sales made up more than 50 percent of Apple's revenue. The decline of iPod sales can not be attributed to the introduction of the iPhone alone, but also to the rising popularity of smartphones, with both types of devices offering similar music features. In 2008, 139.29 million smartphones were sold around the world. By 2016, this figure had increased to almost 1.5 billion. 
 As of 2015, Canada had one of the highest value added energy industries as a percentage of its GDP among the select countries globally. Canada's energy-related industry share of GDP totaled 7.15 percent within this period. Comparatively, Germany’s energy share of their GDP was just 1.5 percent. GDP and the Business Sectors Energy share of a country’s GDP is used as a measure to determine how the energy sector may be influencing the economy. Among the same countries, Norway also had the highest share of energy sector employees as part of business sector employment.This indicates that Norway’s energy sector has had a significant impact on employment and economic growth in recent years. However some other sectors may have a much higher share of the business sector employment and the energy sector represents just a small percentage. In comparison, manufacturing employment had a much larger share of the business sector’s employment in recent years. South Korea had the highest share of manufacturing as a proportion of their business sector GDP between 1993 and 2009. Energy Sector The energy sector is comprised of a variety of types, tools and investors. Among all industries electricity generation and supply has received the most energy sector investments as of 2017. However, solar energy has received the most investment among renewable energy sectors. Within sectors, there are various types of services and equipment needed to manage and transmit energy. In recent years, mid and small sized oilfield services and equipment saw the largest average revenue growth among energy equipment sectors, while offshore drilling experienced negative growth.

 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that prescription drug expenditure in the United States came to some 333 billion U.S. dollars in 2017. This amount includes only retail drug spending, excluding nonretail. Estimations of drug spending can vary by investigating organization. For the U.S., among the most relevant drug spending calculations are provided by CMS, ASPE (Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation), and pharmaceutical market researcher IQVIA. High drug prices in the U.S. The United States is the country with the highest total drug spending and also with the highest per capita pharmaceuticals spending among developed countries. This is mostly connected to higher drug prices in the United States. For example, the price for blockbuster drug Humira was more than three times higher in the United States than in Switzerland in 2015. But whereas in other countries governments more or less directly control drug prices, the U.S. leaves drug pricing to market competition. As a consequence, the U.S. market is the most profitable for pharmaceutical companies. Where the money is spent Nearly half of all Americans have taken at least one prescription medicine within the preceding month. The therapeutic areas where spending is the highest are ‘traditionally’ to be found among antidiabetics, oncologics, autoimmune, and respiratory diseases. Based on number of prescriptions filled, antihypertensives, pain reliever, and mental health drugs are the leading classes. 
 In 2018, the inflation rate in Brazil amounted to about 3.67 percent compared to the previous year, a slight increase from the previous year’s 3.45 percent, but a large improvement compared to 2016 with more than 8 percent. Superlative Brazil Brazil is not only one of the largest countries in the world, it is also one of the largest economies and a member of the so-called BRIC states, four up-and-coming emerging economies. Unfortunately, Brazil also struggles due to an on-going recession; In 2017, the majority of Brazilians described the state of the country’s economy as “bad”. The state of Brazil’s economy Brazil’s mixed economy suffered a severe political and economic crisis in 2014 that only ended in 2016. The country’s GDP slumped dramatically and inflation skyrocketed. As of today, Brazil has recovered, GDP is on the rise again, and inflation is below four percent – however, as a result of the recession that saw millions of job cuts, unemployment is at an all-time high. 
 In 2018, the United States accounted for 15.2 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) after adjusting for purchasing power parity (PPP). This share was expected to decrease to 13.86 percent by 2024, which is roughly a seventh of the global total. What is PPP? The easiest way to understand purchasing power parity is the Big Mac Index, a measure developed by The Economist. The index tracks the price of the McDonald’s Big Mac burger, sold at each of its thousands of restaurants worldwide. Countries where the Big Mac is most expensive have higher purchasing power, meaning one can buy more for each unit of that currency. To calculate PPP, economists use a group of goods to calculate the ratio of the price of this group in each country. This ratio is then used to convert all countries into a standardized price level, on parity with each other. Why use PPP? A U.S. dollar in the United States does not have the same purchasing power as a dollar in China, even after considering the exchange rate. For this reason, adjusting for PPP gives an idea of what the rest of the world could buy in the United States, if prices were the same as in their home country. However, some economists argue that using PPP for comparisons between countries is inaccurate because it changes the price level differently for each country. Still, because it accounts not only for country-specific effects but also inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, PPP is a very popular metric.

 Similar to the years before, U.S. company AbbVie’s Humira maintained its place as the global top ranked drug based on revenue. During 2018, Humira generated a huge 20 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, another significant increase from 18.4 billion dollars the year before. The second ranked drug Eliquis, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, made less than half of Humira’s revenue. Celgene’s Revlimid completed the top ranked three pharmaceutical products worldwide. Top drug Humira Humira is used mostly for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. However, like many other top drugs, the range of medical conditions it can be used to treat is much larger. Thus, the drug is also used to treat Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, uveitis, and some other autoimmune diseases. Humira is administered subcutaneously via injection. It was approved for the first time in 2002 in the United States. Blockbuster drug reliance Blockbuster drugs often have a large impact on the manufacturer. In some cases, pharmaceutical companies are highly dependent on their sales performance. In the case of Humira, AbbVie generates over 60 percent of its total revenue from this drug and almost 80 percent from its top 3 products. Companies that depend on a small number of blockbuster drugs could be under threat of heavy revenue loss. Biosimilars of Humira (adalimumab) are already available and will take more and more of the market in the years to come. Thus, it is not expected that Humira will exceed the 20 billion-dollar-revenue mark but will more likely suffer from a distinct revenue decrease until 2024.

Chicken farming Farming chickens has a distinct advantage over other livestock in that they require relatively little space and minimal initial investment in order to thrive. In the United States, there are two main kinds of farmed chickens: chickens for meat and egg-laying hens. In 2017, there were approximately 504.5 million chickens in the United States. Poultry consumptionPoultry consumption per capita in the United States is expected to plateau in the coming years and remain at around 111 pounds per year. In 2017, the region that spent the most on poultry per consumer unit was the Western United States at 218 U.S. dollars. In comparison, consumer units in the Midwest only spent about 145 U.S. dollars on poultry in that year. When it comes to processed meat and poultry purchases, American consumers tend to prefer national brands to private label. 
 The statistic depicts Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, GDP in Australia amounted to about 1,420.05 trillion US dollars. See global GDP for a global comparison. Australia’s economy and population Australia’s gross domestic product has been growing steadily, and all in all, Australia and its economic key factors show a well-set country. Australia is among the countries with the largest gross domestic product / GDP worldwide, and thus one of the largest economies. It was one of the few countries not severely stricken by the 2008 financial crisis; its unemployment rate, inflation rate and trade balance, for example, were hardly affected at all. In fact, the trade balance of Australia – a country’s exports minus its imports – has been higher than ever since 2010, with a slight dip in 2012. Australia mainly exports wine and agricultural products to countries like China, Japan or South Korea. One of Australia’s largest industries is tourism, which contributes a significant share to its gross domestic product. Almost half of approximately 23 million Australian residents are employed nowadays, life expectancy is increasing, and the fertility rate (the number of children born per woman) has been quite stable. A look at the distribution of the world population by continent shows that Australia is ranked last in terms of population and population density. Most of Australia's population lives at the coast in metropolitan areas, since parts of the continent are uninhabitable. Unsurprisingly, Australia is known as a country with very high living standards, four of its biggest cities – Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney and Perth – are among the most livable cities worldwide. 
 This statistic shows the unemployment rate in Brazil from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate among Brazil's population ranged at approximately 12.22 percent. Employment and economic upswing in Brazil Recent growth in the Brazilian economy was the cause of the considerable improvement of the country’s unemployment rate. In a decade, the country’s unemployment rate was halved and is expected to continue to annually decrease. Brazil is also a member of the so-called BRIC countries, a group consisting of the fastest economically growing emerging countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China. With one of the largest economies not only in the Americas, but also the world, Brazil has maintained one of the highest levels of productivity globally), having produced billions of dollars in goods and services yearly. Additionally, the country’s debt saw slight declines, but is now expected to stabilize. For most developed countries, a debt-to-GDP ratio of roughly 60 percent is considered reasonable. Brazil's debt-to-GDP, despite not being considered a fully developed country yet, is estimated to be at roughly 60 percent and substantially improved over the past several years, primarily due to an increase in the country’s GDP. Brazil’s industrial sector is of high importance to the nation’s total yearly production. Though diverse, Brazil’s industry produces primarily transportation. Furthermore, agriculture plays an important role in economy, with the majority of exports consisting of automobiles and natural resources. Brazil has a variety of trading partners for these goods, most prominently China and the United States. 
 Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 5.53 percent in 2018 after adjusting for inflation. However, projections for the coming years predict that GDP will grow at a rate around 5 percent in the coming years. GDP in developing nations Gross domestic product measures value of all final goods and services produced within a country’s borders during a certain period of time. In developing countries, GDP should rise more quickly due to “catch-up growth”. In many developing nations, employment is shifted from agriculture to the services sector; simply shifting workers from one sector to more productive sectors increases the income of both the workers and their employers, increasing GDP. This raises GDP per capita (383750), which gives a general idea of the level of development. International setting Due to historic tensions, Pakistan neither imports nor exports a significant amount from its neighbor India, favoring China instead. Its other neighbors, Afghanistan and Iran, are not as economically stable at the moment. Pakistan's own GDP is also not in the best shape and is expected to drop during 2019, however, Pakistan stands to benefit from China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which would revive the trading routes that made Pakistan wealthy in past centuries. If this comes to fruition, the GDP for Pakistan is sure to increase. 
 The graph shows China's share in global gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing-power-parity until 2018, with a forecast until 2024. In 2018, China's share was about 18.69 percent. China’s global GDP share – additional information Due to the introduction of capitalist market principles in 1978, China’s economic market began to show immense change and growth. China’s real GDP growth is expected at 5.8 percent in 2022. China’s per capita GDP is also expected to continue to grow into the 2020s, reaching 11,014 U.S. dollars in 2020. Comparatively, Luxembourg and Switzerland have some of the world’s largest GDP per capita with 113,196 U.S. dollars and 83,717 U.S. dollars, respectively, as of 2019. China is the largest importer and exporter of goods in the world and is also among the largest manufacturing economies in the world. The country also ranges among the world’s largest agricultural producers and consumers. It relies heavily on intensive agricultural practices and is the world’s largest producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs. Livestock production has been heavily emphasized since the mid-1970s. China’s chemical industry has also seen growth with a heavy focus on fertilizers, plastics, and synthetic fibers. China is projected to use approximately 29.3 million metric tons of fertilizer in 2020. Industry and construction account for almost half of China’s GDP. Some of the major industries include mining and ore processing, food processing, coal, machinery, textiles and apparel, and consumer products. Almost half of China’s output is dedicated to investment purposes. However, as the country tends to support gross output, innovation, technological advancement, and even quality are often lacking. 
 This statistic shows the 20 countries * with the lowest infant mortality rate in 2017. Estimated 1.8 out of 1,000 live births died in the first year of life in Monaco in 2017. Infant mortality Infant mortality rates are often used as an indicator of the health and well-being of a nation. Monaco, Iceland and Japan are among the top three countries with the lowest infant mortality rates with around 2 infant deaths per 1,000 infants within their first year of life. Generally, the countries with the lowest infant mortality also have some of the highest average life expectancy figures. Additionally, the countries with the highest density of physicians and doctors also generally report low infant mortality. Yet, many different factors contribute to differing rates, including the overall income of a country, health spending per capita, a mother’s level of education, environmental conditions and medical infrastructure, to name a few. This creates a lot of variation concerning the level of childbirth and infant care around the world. The countries with the highest rates of infant mortality include Afghanistan, Mali and Somalia. These countries experience around 100 infant deaths per 1,000 infants in their first year of life. While the reasons for high rates of infant mortality are numerous, the leading causes of death for children under the year of five around the world are Pneumonia, Diarrhea and Prematurity. 
 This graph shows the average expected life span (replacement cycle length) of consumer desktop PCs in the United States, from 2018 to 2023. The source estimates that in 2018 the average desktop in the consumer segment will be replaced past the age of 5.2 years. 
 The statistic presents the personal saving rate in the United States from 1960 to 2019, as of December each year. The personal savings rate amounted to 7.6 percent in 2019 in the United States. Saving – additional information The saving rate is defined as the ratio of money saved by individuals or families to their disposable income (income after taxes). The value of money put aside depends on a number of factors such as employment conditions, inflation, interest rates and the general state of the economy. In 2007, the personal saving rate in the United States amounted to 3.6 percent and increased to 6.4 percent in 2008, following the outbreak of the global financial crisis. The value of personal savings in the United States increased from 359 billion U.S. dollars in 2007, before the crisis, to 665 billion U.S. dollars in 2008. In 2018, it amounted to 1.25 trillion U.S. dollars. There are various reasons behind saving. In the short term, money is usually put aside for current expenses or purchases. In the long term, the main reason behind saving might be buying a house, saving for college or saving for retirement. Some households decide to invest saved money in various financial instruments such as mutual funds, savings bonds or equities
 The number of U.S. participants in gymnastics aged six years and older amounted to approximately 4.81 million in 2017, down from the previous year’s participation by around 10 percent. A participant is defined as an individual who took part in gymnastics at least once in the given year. Gymnastics in the U.S.While participation has decreased, national interest in the sport is relatively high and estimated to keep increasing - in 2018, it was estimated that around 6.8 million Americans were very interested in gymnastics. Part of the rise in interest could be due to the variety and dedication required by gymnasts. The sport primarily includes exercises that require balance, flexibility, strength and control. These exercises can include vault, floor exercise, pommel horse, parallel bars, uneven bars, balance beam, high bar and still rings. Youth participation Children in the U.S. have also shown an attraction to gymnastics. In 2017, 3.1 percent of 6 to 12-year-olds participated regularly in the sport, a figure which has grown over the past 3 years. There is also a clear interest in high school gymnastics in the U.S. with almost 19 thousand high school gymnastic participants in 2017/2018. The majority of this number is female. 
 This statistic shows the poverty rate in the United States among all people from 1990 to 2018. In 2018, the poverty rate was 11.8 percent in the U.S. Poverty in the United States As shown in the statistic above, the poverty rate among all people living in the Unites States has shifted within the last 15 years. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines poverty as follows: “Absolute poverty measures poverty in relation to the amount of money necessary to meet basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. The concept of absolute poverty is not concerned with broader quality of life issues or with the overall level of inequality in society.” The poverty rate in the United States varies widely across different ethnic groups. Black Americans are the ethnic group with the most people living in poverty in 2018, with about 20.8 percent of the Black population with an income below the poverty line. In comparison to that, only 8.1 percent of the White (non-Hispanic) population, were living below the poverty line in 2018. Children are one of the most poverty endangered population groups in the U.S. between 1990 and 2018. Child poverty peaked in 1993 with 18 percent of children living in poverty in that year in the United States. Between 2000 and 2010, the child poverty rate in the United States has been increasing every year; however, in the recent years, there is a trend of decline, reaching 16.2 percent in 2018. The number of people living in poverty in the U.S. varies from state to state. Compared to California, where about 4.66 million people were living in poverty in 2018, the state of Minnesota had about 456,000 people living in poverty. 
 In 2019, total earnings at the North American box office amounted to 11.32 billion U.S. dollars. Whilst this figure remains above 11 billion in line with trends over the last few years, it failed to match the 2018 figure of 11.89 billion, which is the highest figure recorded to date. Box office revenue in North America The film industry uses box office revenue, or, the amount of money generated through movie ticket sales, to measure the commercial success of the films it produces. Ticket sales also account for a sizable portion of the film industry’s total revenues. Over 1.3 billion tickets were sold at the North American box office in 2018. The average ticket price was 9.14 dollars, marking an increase of almost two dollars since 2008. Box office revenues in 2018 were dispersed among a number of leading film studios in North America.

In March 2019, Facebook had almost 216 million unique visitors from the United States, making the it the second-most popular multi-platform web property in the United States. Facebook usage concerns Despite near universal Facebook awareness and wide-ranking adoption, many consumers are wary of the social network’s influence on their digital experience and life. In 2018, the company was plagued by scandals, ranging from being a tool in the alleged foreign influence of the U.S. elections in 2016, to being utilized in spreading misinformation by bad actors due to lax content policies, to the mishandling of user data. During a March 2018 survey, 50 percent of internet users in the United States stated that large digital platforms such as Facebook (and also Google and Twitter) should be regulated.

The average price of a house in the UK increased by 1.1 percent in the 12 months prior to July 2019, reaching an estimated value of roughly 216 thousand British pounds in the second quarter of 2019. Increasing housing prices: a European phenomenon The trend of increasing housing prices is not exclusive to the UK. When comparing several European countries’ residential property RHPI (price index in real terms, e.g. corrected for inflation), houses became more expensive from 2013 onwards in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. Residential in UK not expected to become cheaper Prices are not expected to stop rising. Rather, it is forecasted that residential prices will grow further in the coming years as the British government will start to refocus on domestic issues after Brexit. 
 The statistic shows China's balance of trade from 2008 to 2018. In 2018, China's merchandise trade surplus had amounted to around 351.14 billion U.S. dollars. Trade balance in China – additional information The trade balance is the value of exported goods minus the value of imported goods. A positive value indicates a trade surplus, while a negative value indicates a trade deficit. In 2014, Chinese imports of goods had amounted to approximately 1.96 trillion U.S. dollars, whereas total exports added up to about 2.3 trillion. In contrast, China’s invisible trade balance, an indicator measuring services and government transfers between countries, closed with a deficit and ranged at about -90 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 2013. Being an economy heavily reliant on export, China ranked second among countries with the highest trade surplus in 2013, only outperformed by Germany. The United States, with imports exceeding exports by approximately 750 billion U.S. dollars that year, ranked first among leading import countries worldwide. In 2013, the U.S. was one of the most important trade partners for the Chinese economy. Another important trade partner for China is the European Union. By 2013, the EU imported more than twice as much from China as they exported there, showing a trade deficit of more than 130 billion euros. Product categories with the highest trade deficit in 2013 were mostly finished goods such as manufactured goods, machinery and clothing, whereas product categories with a more balanced trade sheet consisted of raw materials and agricultural products to a large extent.

A settlement agreement was eventually paid by Coca-Cola and also forced the company to put the number of calories on the label and bold text stating, “see nutrition facts for more detail”. 
 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Indonesia from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Indonesia amounted to about 3.2 percent compared to the previous year. The global financial crisis and economic consequences The global economy underwent a drastic slump due to the global financial crisis in 2008, which caused a continued increase in the general level of prices of goods and services; the highest recorded global inflation of the past decade took place in 2008, when the global inflation rate increased by more than 6.4 percent in comparison with the previous year. As for Indonesia, the country's inflation rate amounted to around 9.8 percent in comparison to the previous year. The financial crisis also impacted the global unemployment rate. In 2009, the global unemployment rate jumped to around 6.2 percent, and it is not expected to recover to pre-crisis levels anytime soon. The financial crisis impact on the Indonesian economy was slightly more severe: In 2008, the unemployment rate in Indonesia was around 8.4 percent, much higher than the global unemployment rate for the same year. It has, however, now decreased significantly, even though it is still not below the global level, the country itself has reached lower levels than before the crisis. After the financial crisis, the Indonesian government implemented several economic reforms and increased exports in order to strengthen the economy. In 2011, Indonesia exported goods with a value of more than 200 billion U.S. dollars. The main export partners of Indonesia are Japan, China and Singapore. As a result of increased exports, the Indonesian economy was able to grow, making Indonesia one of the twenty nations in the world with the largest gross domestic product in 2015. 
 40-59-year-olds make up the largest age group in Germany, at 23.9 million people. The most recent figures from 2018 confirm that the next-largest age group was 65 years and older, at 17.88 million. Aging population With the number of people belonging to older age groups visibly outstripping younger ones, in recent years it has become clear that Germany’s population is aging more rapidly than developing. In fact, figures on age structure in Germany during the decade ending in 2017 depict a constant trend of a slowly increasing population share aged over 65. Meanwhile, the share of population members aged 0 to 14 years has been falling, which was also reflected in the fluctuating national birth rate in recent years. A look at the future Germany’s current total population stands at 82.79 million. While this number is predicted to increase, the same goes for the age group of 65 years and older. This means that the national population will continue to age. 
 As of the latest reported period, WhatsApp had more than half a billion daily active Status users worldwide, up from 450 million global DAU in the second quarter of 2018.

WhatsApp and Facebook In February 2014, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook for a then unheard-of figure for such a purchase – 19 billion U.S. dollars. The mobile messenger is one of Facebook’s four billion-user properties, along with the core Facebook platform, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. During the first quarter of 2019, Facebook stated that 2.7 billion people were using at least one of the company's core products (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger) each month. 
 This statistic illustrates the number of active Gmail users worldwide from January 2012 to October 2018. As of the most recently reported period, Google's e-mail service had 1.5 billion active users worldwide. The online service is one of the most popular websites in the United States. Further information E-mail is one of the most common digital communication methods worldwide – first made popular as an easily accessible service offered by many providers, it has now made the successful transition to mobile. Despite the increasing growth of mobile messenger apps, e-mail has remained the leading online communication channel. E-mail access is one of the most popular mobile internet activities worldwide with Google Mail constantly ranking as one of the most popular mobile apps in the United States. Due to its large user base, e-mail is an attractive channel for cyber criminals. Spam accounts for over half of all global e-mail traffic and many countries are targeted by malicious mailshots. According to global internet users, e-mail accounts were most in need of secure passwords, ranked right after online bank accounts. Furthermore, 38 percent of adults in the United States are concerned about government surveillance regarding e-mail communication. Despite this widespread concern, only two percent of U.S. adults are using e-mail encryption programs. 
 Gross domestic product (GDP) of Malaysia grew 4.74 percent in 2018 and was forecast to remain slightly below 5 percent for the medium term. This means that the Malaysian economy will double in size in approximately 15 years, according to the trend. What affects GDP? GDP is the sum of spending in a country by consumers, investors, and the government, plus net exports. High GDP growth is associated with low unemployment, because a growing economy demands a growing labor force. There are also inflationary pressures, but responsible monetary and fiscal policy can keep the inflation rate low. GDP and development Developmental economists focus more on GDP per capita than GDP. Looking at how much each member of the economy generates gives a general idea of the level of development, with strong correlations between this and other development indicators. If population growth is faster than GDP growth, residents in the country will be worse off, in spite of a growing economy. 
 This graph shows the resident population of the United States of America from 1980 to 2019. In 2019, the United States had around 328.23 million inhabitants. See figures for the total population by continent here. 
 This statistic shows the gross sales of Mattel's Barbie brand worldwide from 2012 to 2019. In 2019, Mattel's Barbie brand generated gross sales amounting to about 1.16 billion U.S. dollars, up from about 1.09 billion U.S. dollars the year before.

The commercial success of Barbie has allowed Mattel to become the one of the most valuable toy brand worldwide as of 2019. Although a truly worldwide phenomena, a considerable proportion of Mattel’s sales come from America and Canada. A look at the gross sales of Mattel by region shows that over half of Mattel’s revenues are generated in the North American region. Just as in other business markets, the success of Barbie does not ensure for commercial success to be guaranteed in the future. Competition over retail doll sales in America is fierce. Despite some fluctuation in recent years, the total sales for toy dolls in the U.S. lies consistently in the range of two to three billion U.S. dollars. Given the fluctuation in sales of Barbie dolls it is clear Mattel must maintain interest in Barbie and their other products if they are to retain their current market share. 
 The statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The gross domestic product of the United States in 2018 amounted to around 20.58 trillion U.S. dollars. For comparison, the GDP of China had amounted to 10.43 trillion U.S. dollars, marking the second-largest economy in the world. See U.S. GDP per capita for more information. The United States and the economy The United States’ economy is by far the largest in the world; a status which can be determined by several key factors, one being gross domestic product: A look at the GDP of the main industrialized and emerging countries shows a significant difference between US GDP and the GDP of China, the runner-up in the ranking, as well as the followers Japan, Germany and France. Interestingly, it is assumed that China will have surpassed the States in terms of GDP by 2030, but for now, the United States is among the leading countries in almost all other relevant rankings and statistics, trade and employment for example. See the U.S. GDP growth rate here. Just like in other countries, the American economy suffered a severe setback when the economic crisis occurred in 2008. The American economy entered a recession caused by the collapsing real estate market and increasing unemployment. Despite this, the standard of living is considered quite high; life expectancy in the United States has been continually increasing slightly over the past decade, the unemployment rate in the United States has been steadily recovering and decreasing since the crisis, and the Big Mac Index, which represents the global prices for a Big Mac, a popular indicator for the purchasing power of an economy, shows that the United States’ purchasing power in particular is only slightly lower than that of the euro area.

 About 33 percent of U.S. physicians spent 17-24 minutes with their patients, according to a survey conducted in 2018. Physicians are often constrained in their time directly working with patients, which could have an impact on patient care outcomes. Studies found out that physicians spend almost half of their time in office on data entry and other desk work. More sophisticated, network-enabled EHR (electronic health records) systems for physicians could probably be a step towards more time directly with patients. U.S. physicians Physicians work in a variety of fields and across direct patient care and research. Within the last 50 years, the total number of active physicians has increased dramatically throughout the United States. Among all U.S. states, including the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia had the highest rate of all U.S. states of active physicians. Physician time In a recent study, physicians were asked about the time they spend with their patients. According to the results, a majority of physicians said that they felt their time with patients was limited. In 2018, most physicians saw 11-20 patients per day. Some reports have estimated that for every hour of direct patient contact, physicians spend an additional 2 hours working on reporting and desk work. Recent physician surveys have also indicated that one of the primary reasons for physician burn-out is having too many bureaucratic tasks. 
 The statistic shows the growth rate of the real gross domestic product (GDP) in Japan from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, Japan's GDP increased by 0.81 percent compared to the previous year. For comparison, the GDP growth rate of China had reached about 7.3 percent that same year.Gross domestic product growth rate in Japan GDP serves as one of the most heavily relied upon indicators to gauge the state and health of a country’s economy. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a nation’s borders in a given period of time, usually a year. GDP figures allow a more fundamental understanding of a country’s economy. Year-on-year GDP growth acts as a helpful and clear sign of the direction in which a country is moving in economic terms. Real GDP is especially useful and insightful as it takes price changes (inflation and deflation) into account. The gross domestic product growth rate in Japan has been shaky since the recession of 2008 struck the world economy like a bolt out of the blue and Japan is still yet to gain a solid foothold. Despite its ongoing financial predicament however, Japan remains one of the world’s most highly developed economies. The economy of Japan is the third largest worldwide by nominal GDP and the nation has a very active manufacturing sector. It is active in the auto manufacturing sector, the third largest in the world after the United States and China, and has an electronics industry that is counted among the worlds most innovative. Japan can boast many titles, but perhaps the most significant to its future stability is that which relates to its astronomical national debts, currently running at over 200 percent of GDP, roughly 10.5 trillion US dollars. 
 According to a study carried out by Deezer in May 2018, the most popular genre among Americans was rock music, with 56.8 percent of respondents stating that they were currently listening to music within this genre as of the date of survey. Pop and country music were the second and third most popular genres respectively, and 20.2 percent of respondents said they preferred jazz. The appeal of rock and pop music The broad appeal of rock and pop music can in part be attributed to how both genres often blend seamlessly into one another and influence other music styles. Heavy rock bands like Led Zeppelin and AC/DC are often more divisive than melodic rock groups like Bon Jovi or Genesis, just like pop music which strays into R&B territory or is better associated with hip hop or EDM. Each have their appeal to fans with different tastes, and the versatility of rock and pop (and music which combines the two) allows such music to reach adults of all ages and backgrounds. Rock albums also account for the majority of vinyl album sales in the United States, with pop albums ranking second. However, although the resurgence of vinyl has to a certain extent been reliant on the rock genre, this is not the case when it comes to digital music consumption. Rap and hip hop accounted for 22.8 percent of music video streams in the U.S. in 2018, whereas for rock music videos the share was just 7.1 percent. Rock fared similarly when it came to audio streams, once again losing out to rap and hip hop. Taking such data into consideration, it would seem that rock music fans are generally more drawn to traditional formats and are less inclined to enjoy their music via streaming platforms. 
 This statistic represents the worldwide number of Honda employees from the fiscal year of 2002 to the fiscal year ended March 2018. In the 2018 fiscal year, Honda’s workforce rose to 215,638 people. Honda's employees Honda is a Japan-based manufacturing company that specializes in transportation; the company is counted among the leading vehicle manufacturing companies worldwide. Honda has been active in a variety of fields, including engines and generators, motorcycles, industrial trucks, garden equipment, robots and bicycles. The company's business segments include the motorcycle business, automobile business, financial services business, as well as power products and other businesses. 
 This statistic shows the global platinum metal reserves as estimated as of 2019, by country. The United States had estimated reserves of around 900 metric tons of platinum metal in 2019. Platinum is a so called transition metal and one of the rarest elements on Earth. Estimated reserves of platinum metals Total worldwide reserves of platinum metals are estimated to be some 69,000 metric tons. Almost all of it, some 95 percent, is located in the Earth’s crust of South Africa. Far behind it, other major countries are Russia, the United States, and Canada. The United States is estimated to have platinum metal reserves of some 900 metric tons. Platinum in most cases is a by-product of copper and nickel mines and refineries. On the other hand, the largest pure platinum mines are in South Africa, which is also the world’s leading producer of the element. Around 130 metric tons were produced there in 2019. Russia, as the second largest platinum miner, produced some 22 metric tons. The United States reported a platinum mine production of 3.6 metric tons. The largest platinum miner worldwide is South African mining company Anglo American Platinum Ltd., headquartered in Johannesburg. Other leading platinum companies are Impala Platinum (South Africa), Sibanye Gold Ltd. (South Africa), and Lonmin (United Kingdom). Since 1901, the price of platinum has been mostly higher than the price of gold. Platinum is mainly used for vehicle emission control devices and jewelry, but is also in high demand for laboratory devices and as an investment. Through its rarity, platinum became a symbol of prestige, manifesting itself, for example, in platinum awards and platinum credit cards. The crown for the coronation of King George VI of England in 1937 was the first one to be made of platinum. 
 During October 2019, Amazon.com had almost 2.15 billion combined desktop and mobile visits, down from 2.18 billion visits in May 2019. The platform is by far the most visited e-commerce property in the United States. Online retail in the United States Online retail in the United States is constantly growing. In the third quarter of 2019, e-commerce sales accounted for 11.2 percent of retail sales in the United States. During that quarter, U.S. retail e-commerce sales amounted to over 154.54 billion U.S. dollars. Some retail categories are performing stronger in terms of e-commerce sales than others: in the apparel and accessories segment, 26.1 percent of total retail revenue was generated online. However, digital only accounted for two percent of U.S. grocery revenues. Amazon usage in the United States As the most popular online shopping platform, Amazon’s influence on consumers shopping behavior extends beyond its own website. According to a February 2019 survey of U.S. Amazon users, 66 percent of respondents stated that they started their online product research on Amazon. Of course, Amazon is not only popular for product research but ultimately, also for making the purchase. The most important factors driving users to purchase via Amazon are pricing and low shipping costs. 
 Global consumption of rice has seen a slight increase over the last several years. In the 2018/2019 crop year, about 490.27 million metric tons of rice was consumed worldwide, up from 437.18 million metric tons in the 2008/2009 crop year. Rice cultivation Rice requires specific growing conditions to be successfully cultivated. It must be grown in a flooded field in several inches of water. Once the unprocessed rice is harvested, it is known as paddy rice. In 2017, China produced 210.3 million metric tons of paddy rice, making that country the top producer of paddy rice worldwide. India had the largest harvest area of rice in the 2017/2018 crop year, at 43.79 million hectares, while China harvested 30.18 million hectares of rice in that year. Rice trade worldwide In addition to having the largest harvest area of rice, India also was the top exporter of rice in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. During that time period, India exported 12.5 million metric tons of rice. Despite being the top producer of rice worldwide, China’s consumption of rice cannot be satisfied by domestic production. China is also the top importer of rice of any country in the world, at over 4.5 million metric tons of rice. 
 This statistic depicts the leading 20 e-retailers worldwide in 2015, based on retail revenue. In that year, Amazon was the world's leading retailer with about 79.27 billion U.S. dollars worth of revenue. Amazon is headquartered in the United States, one of the leading e-commerce markets worldwide. In 2016, retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. amounted to over 322 billion U.S. dollars and are projected to surpass 485 billion U.S. dollars in 2021. Online-only retailers such as Amazon were the most popular type of online store to make online purchases according to a 2016 survey of North American online shoppers. Latin American shoppers preferred retailer websites. 
 The time series shows the net revenue of Amazon.com's e-commerce and service sales from 2004 to 2019, in billion US dollars. In the last reported year, the multinational e-commerce company's net revenue was 280.5 billion U.S. dollars, up from 177.86 billion US dollars in 2017. Amazon.com, an American electronic commerce company originally founded in 1994, is the world’s largest online retailer of books, clothing, electronics, music and many more goods. As of 2019, the company generates the majority of it's net revenues through online retail product sales, followed by third-party retail seller services, retail subscription services including Amazon Prime, and AWS. Amazon is also the producer of the leading e-book reader, the Amazon Kindle. Through Amazon, consumers are able to purchase goods at a rather discounted price from both small and large companies as well as from other users. Both new and used goods are sold on the website. Due to the wide variety of goods available at prices which often undercut local brick-and-mortar retail offerings, Amazon has dominated the retailer market. As of 2019, Amazon’s brand worth amounts to approximately almost 315 billion U.S. dollars, topping the likes of companies such as Walmart, Ikea, as well as digital competitors Alibaba and eBay. One of Amazon's first forays into the world of hardware was its e-reader Kindle, one of the most popular e-book readers worldwide. In recently years, Amazon has also released smartphone, tablets and multimedia sticks under it's Fire brand in order to increase digital media consumption via these devices. This strategy is connected to the digital Amazon ecosystem which features video and audio content as value-added services for Prime subscribers. Due to its location, Amazon offers more services in North America than worldwide. As a result, the majority of the company’s net revenue in 2019 was actually earned in the United States and Canada. In 2019, approximately 170.77 billion U.S. dollars was earned in North America compared to only roughly 74.7 billion U.S. dollars internationally. 
 This statistic represents the average price of bentonite between 2007 and 2019. In 2019, the average bentonite price stood at approximately 100 U.S. dollars per ton. Bentonite is a type of clay along with ball clay, common clay, and fire clay. Bentonite – additional informationBentonite is an absorbent aluminum phyllosilicate clay which is frequently generated from the alteration of volcanic ash. It consists predominantly of montmorillonite, a clay mineral. In 1898, Bentonite was first discovered in 1898 and classified in Fort Benton, Wyoming. Bentonite products have properties which give them a wide and diverse range of uses and applications. Its ability to expand in water is one of its most important properties, giving bentonite its voluminous and gelatinous mass. There are several different types of bentonite, such as, sodium bentonite, calcium bentonite and potassium bentonite. Sodium and calcium bentonites are primarily used for various industrial purposes. In iron and steel production processes, bentonite is widely used as a binding agent. For example, sodium bentonite is commonly used for large castings while calcium bentonite is more often used for smaller castings. The United States was one of the key producers of bentonite in 2016, followed by China and Greece. In 2019, the U.S. exported around 820 thousand metric tons of bentonite to other countries.Another common use of bentonite is as a cat litter, due to its advantage of absorbing refuse by forming clumps and leaving the rest of the product for further use. During the period from 1996 through 2014, bentonite was, by far, the most popular cat litter material used in North America and Europe. 
 In 2019, the unemployment rate in Pakistan was at approximately 3.02 percent, a slight decrease from 3.04 percent the previous year. Unemployment as an economic key indicator The unemployment rate of a country represents the share of people without a job in the country’s labor force, i.e. unemployed persons among those who are able and/or willing to work. Among other factors, it takes population growth into account, and thus increases in the labor force, as well as the age of the population. A high unemployment rate usually indicates economic troubles, with a popular example being Greece, where the unemployment rate skyrocketed from 7.76 percent in 2008 to 27.5 percent as a result of the Great Recession. From plowshares to keyboards While Pakistan’s unemployment slumped below the one percent mark in 2010, it is now on the rise again and currently standing at just over four percent. Traditionally, most Pakistanis work in agriculture however, the lion’s share of the country’s GDP is generated by services, like tourism, banking, and IT. While agriculture is still important for Pakistan’s economy, the services sector is gaining ground in the country, and more and more people are moving to urban areas from the countryside to find jobs in the cities. 
 This statistic shows the number of Facebook users in Malaysia from 2017 to 2023. In 2023, the number of Facebook users in Malaysia is expected to reach 24.2 million, up from 22 million in 2017. Further information With more than 2 billion monthly active users, Facebook is the most popular social network worldwide. Popular activities on the social network include watching videos, liking content via button, reading articles and messaging friends on 1-1 basis. In July 2016, Facebook Messenger surpassed one billion monthly active users, placing it directly next to Facebook-owned competitor WhatsApp. Facebook successfully managed the transition from social network to mobile social platform with mobile accounting for 97 percent of the social network’s total advertising revenue in 2016. Mobile is also the keyword regarding the online market in Malaysia; in 2016, 17.9 million people accessed the internet through their mobile phone. In 2021, this figure is projected to amount to 21.72 million mobile phone internet users. As of March 2017, the internet penetration in Malaysia was 67.7 percent. According to September 2016 data, 62 percent of the Malay population were active social media users. More than 17 million users access social media via mobile on a monthly basis, making it one of the biggest Facebook markets in the Southeast Asian region. The average internet connection speed in Malaysia is 6.4 Mbps, less than a quarter of market leader’s, South Korea’s, average speed of 29 Mbps. 
 This statistic shows the total population of Greece from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the total population of Greece was around 10.74 million people. Population of Greece After a subtle year-over-year increase from 2004 to 2011, the population of Greece has experienced a slight drop from 2011 until 2014. Population growth decreased marginally in 2011 compared to the previous year, and once again in 2012 in comparison to 2011. Greek women also bore fewer children per woman on average in 2011, a slight decrease from 2010. But a lower fertility rate is not necessarily the only reason for the country’s total population decline, Greece’s recent economic downturn also plays a role. Due to poor decisions in regards to spending made by the government, Greece has suffered through an economic crisis since 2010, diminishing the incentive to live in the country. The unemployment rate dramatically surged since the crisis, reaching a decade high in 2013. Additionally, the country’s GDP has significantly dropped in the same time frame from 2008 to 2013, with the largest slump in GDP growth occurring in 2011. Despite a severe economic slump, Greece still managed to maintain a relatively high HDI value in 2012, preserving a spot among the top 30 countries worldwide. The HDI, or Human Development Index, is based on parameters such as literacy rate, education levels, GNI and life expectancy, which was one of the highest in the world in 2011. 
 Global pizza chain Pizza Hut’s average sales per unit reached approximately 878 thousand U.S. dollars in 2017, down from 900 thousand the previous year. Sales per store have remained reasonably steady over the years, with the lowest figure being 725 thousand U.S. dollars and the highest at 900 thousand. YUM! Brands subsidiaries Pizza Hut is owned by YUM! Brands, which is also parent company to restaurant chains Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Taco Bell. Out of all the quick service chains in the U.S. Pizza Hut ranked thirty ninth in terms of sales per unit in the U.S. - placing after its sister companies, which had average sales per unit of 1.6 million U.S. dollars (Taco Bell) and 1.21 million (KFC). Topping the list was chicken chain Chick-fil-A with average sales per unit of 4.17 million U.S. dollars. Who tops the pizza market? Pizza is a popular dish with people all over the world - especially U.S. consumers. In a 2018 ranking, Pizza Hut placed second in terms of pizza chain sales, having generated 5.53 billion U.S. dollars. While this was a valiant effort, Domino’s Pizza ultimately ranked first with over six and a half billion U.S. dollars in sales in 2018. 
 For the past few years, Sri Lanka’s economy has been thriving. Gross domestic product is soaring, and despite the densely populated country being among the smallest in the Asia Pacific region, its GDP per capita is not – it has almost doubled over the past decade. Sri Lanka’s inflation rate has been through the wringer, however: From around seven percent in 2013 to a sudden slump to around two percent in 2015 with a rapid upturn and peak at 6.5 percent in 2017 again, it is expected to stabilize around the 4.9 percent-mark over the next few years. The slump in 2015 is mainly due to the country amassing national debt, which is soaring just as much as GDP. Sri Lanka has been spending so much money on developing its infrastructure, it needed help from the International Monetary Fund. Bailed out The International Monetary Fund does not just bail a country out frivolously, although Sri Lanka is by far not the only one requesting financial aid. Other countries have turned to the IMF for help in the past, the most famous example of asking for a bailout is Greece, which still struggles with the consequences of economic turmoil, austerity, and debt years later. Bailout money comes with terms and conditions, since it is a temporary solution to facilitate resolving an economic crisis. Often, one of these conditions is that countries take matters into their own hands and do everything they can to avoid further crises and to help get themselves out of debt. Maxing out the cards Sri Lanka has been living above its means, but prognoses look promising. Inflation is expected to level off around five percent, as is government expenditure at around 20 percent of GDP. Debt is still rising, of course, but trade seems in good shape, as well, with exports increasing, lowering the trade deficit. All in all, it looks like investing in infrastructure may pay off after all. 
 Mobile telephones have become increasingly relevant to many aspects of modern life, a phenomenon that is evidenced by the development in the rate of households owning a mobile telephone. Currently, approximately 95 percent of households in the United Kingdom (UK) own a mobile phone, a figure that has remained constant since 2015. That sits in stark contrast with 2000-2001, when less than half of all households in the UK reported owning a mobile telephone. Smartphones leading the charge Given their role as the digital swiss army knife of modern tech, it is no surprise that smartphones are behind much of the growth in this space. Smartphone adoption reached 78 percent during the first half of 2018, up from 29 percent at the beginning of 2011. Smartphone ownership drops off steeply for users aged 55 or older, with just 55 percent of residents in that age group reporting that they own a smartphone compared with 95 percent of people aged from 16 to 24 and 25 to 34 years of age. Apple on top The smartphone market is evenly divided between iOS and Android, indicating that Apple is the UK’s preferred smartphone manufacturer. In April 2019, the iPhone XR, iPhone XS Max and the iPhone 8 claimed 24 percent of the market during April 2019, taking three of the top five positions. 
 This statistic shows corporate profits in the United States from 2012 to 2019, by quarter. The corporate profits are defined as the net income of corporations in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Corporations in the U.S. made profits of around 2.08 trillion U.S. dollars in the third quarter of 2019. 
 This graph shows the average number of people per family in the U.S. from 1960 to 2019. The average American family in 2019 consisted of 3.14 persons. Families in the United States According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a family is a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family. As of 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau counted about 83.48 million families in the United States. The average family consisted of 3.14 persons in 2019, down from 3.7 in the 1960s. This is reflected in the decrease of children in family households overall. In 1970, about 56 percent of all family households had children under the age of 18 living in the household. This percentage declined to 40.66 percent in 2019. The average size of a family household varies greatly from state to state. The largest average families can be found in Utah and Hawaii, with an average of 3.61 members respectively. The smallest families can be found in Vermont and Maine, with an average size of 2.88 and 2.85 members respectively. 
 This statistic shows the distribution of the population in France on January 1st, 2019, by age group. In 2019, people aged under 15 accounted for more than 17 percent of the total French population, whereas slightly more than 9 percent of the population were 75 years and older. By comparison, the number of members of the population over the age of 65 years has increased even more prominently, growing by 3.92 million, amounting to 5.9 percent in 2017. The number of people living in France has been steadily increasing since 2004, reaching 66.99 million in 2017, having thus grown by 7 percent during that time. There were 32.3 million males and 34.3 million females among the French population. 
 This statistic shows the Ukrainian gross domestic product (GDP) from 1994 to 2018 in billion U.S. dollars, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, Ukraine's GDP amounted to approximately 130.86 billion U.S. dollars. See the Russian GDP for comparison. Ukraine's rocky economy In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, GDP in Ukraine has been dramatically reduced to half its amount. This very severe decrease is mainly due to the armed conflict in the eastern part of the country, which is causing many of its inhabitants to be internally displaced, and life in general to become increasingly difficult for Ukrainians - not just because of the war, but because the country’s economy is in desperate trouble: The inflation rate has risen to almost 50 percent, the second highest rate around the world behind Venezuela, and unemployment is now at over 11 percent. The industrial Donbass region located to the east of the country has also been devastated. Russia, Ukraine’s most important import and export partner until recently, most likely no longer plays this role, having caused a great shift in the country’s base economy. Ukraine’s national debt in relation to GDP is also unsustainable, having increased by over 50 percent in the last two years. Default or restructuring of its debt was inevitable, and eventually restructuring took place in August 2015. While the economy is expected to recover somewhat in 2016, its stability will depend on improving the stability of the country in order to create an environment in which the economy can operate and recover. 
 This statistic shows the global market share held by Samsung in the smartphone market from the second quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Samsung had a global smartphone market share of 18.8 percent. Samsung’s smartphone market share – additional information The smartphone market has drastically changed since 2009. Nokia used to lead the industry with almost 50 percent of the smartphone market share in 2007, but the company’s market presence dropped to nearly three percent in 2013. Apple and Samsung have remained amongst the top five smartphone vendors in the world since 2009. Samsung’s Galaxy, first released in 2009, is their main line of smartphone products, while Apple heavily invests on the iPhone, the company’s primary source of revenue. Samsung’s smartphone market share increased significantly in a time span of three years, going from three percent in the second quarter of 2009 to 32.2 percent in the second quarter of 2012. None of its competitors have experienced such strong growth in the last few years. As the overall smartphone market grew as well, Samsung was able to maintain its position as global market leader. In 2015 alone, the Korean electronics giant shipped more than 320 million smartphones worldwide, accounting for 21.6 percent of all smartphone shipments worldwide. Samsung shipped more smartphones than Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi combined. Apple remains a distant second, with about 216 million iPhones shipped worldwide and around 15 percent of the market share in 2017. 
 In 2018, global mobile data traffic amounted to 19.01 exabytes per month. By 2022, mobile data traffic is expected to reach 77.5 exabytes per month worldwide at a compound annual growth rate of 46 percent. Mobile traffic Mobile accounts for approximately half of web traffic worldwide. In the first quarter of 2019, mobile devices (excluding tablets) generated 48.71 percent of global website traffic, consistently hovering around the 50 percent mark since the beginning of 2017. Some regions have wider mobile internet adoption than others. Many developing digital markets are mobile-first, having leapfrogged desktop PC internet due to cost and infrastructural restraints. Asia and Africa have a higher share of mobile web traffic than the global average and in March 2019, mobile devices accounted for over 73 percent of web traffic in Nigeria. Mobile broadband Mobile video, gaming and app downloads are only a few examples of mobile internet activities that require a mobile broadband connection with sufficient speed. In April 2019, Norway was ranked first among the countries with the fastest average mobile internet speed. However, the speed of mobile internet connections is one thing, mobile phone network coverage is another. In 2018, 98 percent of the European population had mobile broadband with only two percent of the population not having mobile broadband coverage. By contrast, the MBB coverage gap in Sub-Saharan Africa amounted to 47 percent of the population, highlighting the disparities in digital access worldwide. 
 In 2018, the inflation rate in Ireland amounted to about 0.73 percent compared to the previous year. Ireland’s inflation is forecast to stabilize over the coming years at around two percent. The Irish recession Ireland’s economy was the first one in the EU to collapse and enter a recession during the financial crisis of 2008. Unemployment skyrocketed, gross domestic product declined, many Irish workers emigrated to find jobs elsewhere, and even a decade later, Ireland still struggles to return to its former standards. GDP growth, for example, still fluctuates considerably, just like inflation, and unemployment seems to have only just recovered. To good health and a stable economy The Central European Bank recommends a stable inflation around two percent as ideal, and Ireland seems to be on the right track. Most of its GDP is generated by services, for example tourism and financial services. However, the alcohol industry is also an important player: In 2018, more than 3.7 billion U.S. dollars in revenue were reported by the Irish alcoholic drinks market. 
 The highest average monthly salary in Sweden in 2018 was found within the sector of financial institutions and insurance companies. The average monthly salary for employees at companies within this sector amounted to almost 52 thousand Swedish kronor in 2018, which is significantly higher than the average monthly salary for individuals with a tertiary education in Sweden. Increasing insurance companies and employees The number of insurance companies at the market in Sweden was decreasing for several years, but increased again in 2017, and almost 21 thousand individuals in Sweden were employed within insurance companies during 2017. Hotel and restaurant industry lowest on the list At the bottom of the list of average monthly salary in Sweden was hotels and restaurants, where the average monthly salary amounted to around 25 thousand Swedish kronor. The hotel business in Sweden though is a growing employer, with many individuals that already are employed within the industry, and the number of employees has been increasing close to annually since 2006. 
 In 2017, the total population of the Philippines was at approximately 104.92 million inhabitants. For the foreseeable future, the Filipino population is expected to increase slightly, despite a current overall downward trend in population growth. The dwindling Filipino population For now, the population figures in the Philippines still show a steady increase and the country is still one of the most densely populated countries in the Asia-Pacific region, however, all signs point to a decline in the number of inhabitants in the long run: Just like the population growth rate, the country’s fertility rate, for example, has also been decreasing for years now, while the death rate has been increasing simultaneously. Poor healthcare to blame One of the reasons for the downward trend is the aging population; fewer babies are born each year, while life expectancy at birth has been steady over the years. Another reason is poor healthcare in the country: The Philippines have a high tuberculosis incidence rate, a highly infectious disease, and are among the countries with a high probability of death from noncommunicable diseases as well. 
 Among OECD countries in 2018, South Korea had the highest rate of yearly visits to a doctor per capita. South Korea had an average rate of 17 yearly visits with a doctor per capita at that time. Health care utilization is an important indicator of the success of a country’s health care system. There are many factors that affect health care utilization including healthcare structure and the supply of health care providers. OECD health systems Healthcare systems globally include a variety of tools for accessing healthcare, including private insurance based systems, like in the U.S., and universal systems, like in the U.K. Health systems have varying costs among the OECD countries. Worldwide, Europe has the highest expenditures for health as a proportion of the GDP. Among all OECD countries, The United States had the highest share of government spending on health care. Recent estimates of current per capita health expenditures showed that Switzerland and the United States have the highest per capita spending on health worldwide. Supply of health providersGlobally, the country with the highest physician density is Cuba. According to recent estimates, among just OECD countries Austria has the highest density of practicing physicians. The number of graduates of medicine impacts the number of available physicians in countries. Among OECD countries, Ireland had the highest rate of graduates of medicine, which was almost twice the rate of the OECD average. 
 In 2018, the number of tourists in South Africa amounted to 16.44 million – a figure that steadily increased over the past five years and is expected to see growth in the future. By 2023, it was forecasted that the number of tourists in South Africa would reach 19.6 million. South Africa tourist arrivals South Africa came second in a ranking of the leading African countries in terms of international tourist arrivals. It only had around one million less international tourist arrivals than the most visited country, Morocco. The tourism industry is one of the key industries in South Africa attracting visitors from all over the world. In 2018, the largest number of visitors to South Africa from a non-African country came from the United Kingdom with 430,708 visitors. Who has the most hotels in Africa? South Africa offered the highest number of chain and branded hotels in relation to other selected African countries in 2017, with a figure amounting to 430. Comparatively, Morocco, which was top of the list of most visited African countries, accounted for a smaller total of 153 chain and branded hotels. 
 In the most recently reported fiscal year, Google's revenue amounted to 160.74 billion US dollars. Google's revenue is largely made up by advertising revenue, which amounted to 134.81 billion US dollars in 2019. As of June 2019, parent company Alphabet ranked fourth among worldwide internet companies, with a market capitalization of 741 billion U.S. dollars. Google’s revenue Founded in 1998, Google is a multinational internet service corporation headquartered in California, United States. Initially conceptualized as a web search engine based on a PageRank algorithm, Google now offers a multitude of desktop, mobile and online products. Google Search remains the company’s core web-based product along with advertising services, communication and publishing tools, development and statistical tools as well as map-related products. Google is also the producer of the mobile operating system Android, Chrome OS, Google TV as well as desktop and mobile applications such as the internet browser Google Chrome or mobile web applications based on pre-existing Google products. Recently, Google has also been developing selected pieces of hardware which ranges from the Nexus series of mobile devices to smart home devices and driverless cars. Due to its immense scale, Google also offers a crisis response service covering disasters, turmoil and emergencies, as well as an open source missing person finder in times of disaster. Despite the vast scope of Google products, the company still collects the majority of its revenue through online advertising on Google Site and Google network websites. Other revenues are generated via product licensing and most recently, digital content and mobile apps via the Google Play Store, a distribution platform for digital content. As of November 2019, the highest-grossing Android apps worldwide included mobile games such as Candy Crush Saga, Pokemon Go, and Tinder. 
 The statistic depicts the revenue from the Premier League television broadcasting rights from 1992 to 2019. From 2013 to 2016 the Premier League generated over 3 billion pounds in revenue from its marketing of TV broadcasting rights per year. 
 This statistic shows the average number of people per family in Canada in 2017, distinguished by province. In 2017, Nunavut was ranked first with the average family size of 3.7 people. The average number of people per family in Canada was 2.9 in 2017. The average family size dropped from 3 to 2.9 after 2003 and has remained stable since. 
 The statistic shows the average inflation rate in Turkey from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Turkey was at around 16.33 percent compared to the previous year. Turkey’s economy With a continuously growing gross domestic product /GDP and thus a rising share in the global GDP adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, Turkey’s economy is one of the largest worldwide. By 2030, Turkey is estimated to be one of the countries with the highest gross domestic product worldwide. Import of goods figures and export figures are rising as well, however, the trade balance of Turkey has been in the negative range for several years now with a downwards trend which indicates a serious trade deficit – or in other words: an imbalance between export and import costs; the value of goods Turkey imports is a lot higher than the value of exported goods. Main export partners of Turkey for textiles, automotive goods, iron and steel, among other goods, are mostly European countries, with Germany leading the ranking, followed by Iraq, Great Britain, Italy and France. The most important economic sector for Turkey is the services sector, especially the tourism sector, which has experienced a significant boost over the last decade. Thus, Turkey is now among the most popular destinations for visitors of all nations. A look at gross domestic product /GDP growth in Turkey shows that the country suffered a brief setback during the economic crisis of 2008, but swiftly recovered and was back in the black by 2010. Turkey’s employment figures hardly suffered at all, they too recovered quickly and are now back to pre-crisis levels. 
 This statistic shows the total lobbying spending in the United States from 1998 to 2019. In 2019, the total lobbying spending amounted to 3.47 billion U.S. dollars. Additional information on lobbying in the United States Since the turn of the millennium, the amount spent on lobbying in the United States has more than doubled. The intention of firms employing lobbyists, who in turn lobby government officials, is to gain a degree of influence on the legislative process in the hope of legislation more favorable to their business or cause being passed. Lobbying occurs at all levels from local government to presidential elections. The industries utilizing lobbying as a means to gain influence come from a range of industries with the biggest spenders including pharmaceuticals, insurance, business associations as well as oil and gas. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a pro business association, was the largest lobbying spender in 2018 by a considerable margin. Lobbying by the National Rifle Association has gained both domestic and global attention. Many observers have pointed to the lobby power of the National Rifle Association when attempting to explain the perceived lack of change in regards to gun control laws. Examples such as the national rifle association, alongside increasing lobbying spending, have lead to increased attention on the lobbying industry and the potential consequences of the industry’s increasing influence. Movements such as the Occupy Movement and protests against free-trade deals with other countries have called for restrictions on lobbying and the asymmetrical power it allows large corporations. 
 The District of Columbia had the highest robbery rate in the United States in 2017, with 343.8 robberies per 100,000 inhabitants. The lowest robbery rate in the country was found in Vermont, with 11.2 robbers per 100,000 inhabitants. Crime in the District of Columbia The violent crime rate in the District of Columbia was also the highest in the country in 2018, and there are a few reasons for this: Firstly, the population of the District of Columbia is quite low (causing a higher rate of crime), and secondly, issues such as the crack epidemic of the 1990s exacerbated the prevalence of crime in the District. As rising rents and gentrification force more people out of the District, crime is moving into neighboring Maryland and Virginia suburbs, as poorer residents seek more affordable living conditions. Crime in the United States Overall, violent crime in the United States and the District of Columbia today is far below the violent crime rate of the 1990s. While some may feel that crime is on the rise, due in part to media sensationalism, in fact the opposite is true, and the United States are becoming safer over time. 
 With a brand value of around 75 billion U.S. dollars, Samsung was the most valuable South Korean brand in 2018, greatly surpassing Hyundai, LG as well as SK Hynix. With its headquarters in the northwestern South Korean city of Suwon, Samsung is a world leader in the manufacturing of consumer electronics and semiconductors. Globally, Samsung produces more smartphones and mobile phones than any other brand, and has a strong presence in the tablet, television and computer components markets. The evolution of Samsung In its early days, Samsung was recognized for producing cheap consumer electronic alternatives. Customer perceptions have changed over the years, largely due to Samsung’s successful branding and advertising strategy adopted in the 90s. Today, innovation and creativity are both values which Samsung seeks to encapsulate through its products. Accordingly, Samsung smartphone owners are loyal, with 77 percent of global Samsung consumers opting for their next purchase to be a Samsung mobile rather than an Apple iPhone. Samsung in numbers Samsung has come a long way from its early establishment in South Korea to its current position as a globally recognized multinational conglomerate. It achieved a global revenue of around 218 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. The largest department in terms of employment at Samsung’s headquarters was the ‘Device Solutions’ division in 2018. This department is responsible for ensuring the ‘inner workings’ of Samsung’s electronic devices are optimized in terms of performance and reliability. Most product development is not based in South Korea itself. As of the 3rd quarter of 2018, Samsung had registered over double the number of patents in the United States compared to in South Korea during that year. Consequently, global research and development spending at Samsung Electronics reached a 10-year high in 2018 - a trend that looks likely to continue in coming years. 
 The above statistic shows the number of internet users in selected African countries as of June 2019. As of that month, Nigeria had 123.49 million internet users. Second-ranked Egypt had 49.23 million users. As of March 2019, the majority of web traffic in leading digital markets in Africa originated from mobile devices - in Nigeria, one of the countries with the biggest number of internet users worldwide, 74 percent of web traffic was generated via smartphones and only 24 percent via PC devices. This is connected to the fact that mobile connections are much cheaper and do not require the infrastructure that is needed for traditional desktop PCs with fixed-line internet connections. 
 The statistic shows the average inflation rate in Canada from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket. This product basket contains products and services, on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Canada was approximately 2.24 percent compared to the previous year. For comparison, inflation in India amounted to 5.22 percent that same year. Inflation in Canada In general, the inflation rate in Canada follows a global trend of decreasing inflation rates since 2011, with the lowest slump expected to occur during 2015, but forecasts show an increase over the following few years. Additionally, Canada's inflation rate is in quite good shape compared to the rest of the world. While oil and gas prices have dropped in Canada much like they have around the world, food and housing prices in Canada have been increasing. This has helped to offset some of the impact of dropping oil and gas prices and the effect this has had on Canada´s inflation rate. The annual consumer price index of food and non-alcoholic beverages in Canada has been steadily increasing over the last decade. The same is true for housing and other price indexes for the country. In general there is some confidence that the inflation rate will not stay this low for long, it is expected to return to a comfortable 2 percent by 2017 if estimates are correct.

Ford is employer to some 13,000 people at its engine plants in Bridgend, Dagenham and the partly owned transmission plant in Halewood. 
 Some 25 percent of Canadian consumers surveyed stated that they had consumed cannabis, or marijuana as it is otherwise known, the past year in 2019. This is a three percent increase from 2018, when 22 percent of survey respondent had consumed the drug in the last year. Canada became only the second country worldwide to legalize the use of marijuana for recreational purposes in all of their provinces in 2018. How can cannabis be consumed? Cannabis can come in various forms, and with this comes different ways to consume the product. 83.2 percent of surveyed recreational cannabis users stated that they smoked the product. Smoking cannabis in handmade cigarettes utilizes the dried flower form of the product. With the recent legalization of the manufacturing and sale of e-cigarettes in Canada, it is likely that an increasing number of consumers will use vape pens to inhale this herbal form in the future. Cannabis can also be combined with food and drink products. Baked goods such as cookies and brownies are the type of cannabis edible most consumers are interested in trying.Cannabis regulation in Canada Regulation of the drug is not a straight forward topic, there has been issues keeping up with demand and not everyone agrees with the legalization of non-medical marijuana. As of October 2018, over half of Canadians approved of the legalization. There is also an ongoing debate on how cannabis should be regulated, if it should be treated more like alcohol or tobacco.
 This statistic shows the top twenty-five fastest growing counties in the United States as of July 1, 2018, by change in population from April 1, 2010. On July 1, 2018, the fastest growing county with 10,000 or more population in the United States was Williams County in North Dakota with a growth rate of 57.8 percent. 
 The statistic shows the U.S. total arms exports in 2018 expressed in TIV, by country. The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer. The TIV is expressed here in million constant U.S. dollars as of 1990. In 2018, the U.S. arms exports to Saudi Arabia totaled to about 3,353 million constant (1990) U.S. dollars. The depicted value is only an indicator and does not correspond to the actual financial value of the transfers. 
 Sports company Adidas was valued at over 16.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, an increase from around seven billion U.S. dollars in 2016. The multinational corporation is the second-largest sportswear company in the world. Adidas is in the game Footwear is a crucial product for Adidas, with over 50 percent of net sales generated by the category, selling 409 million pairs of shoes in 2018 alone. European football (soccer) is one of Adidas main focal points, with the brand sponsoring top clubs such as Manchester United, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid. The sports company is a recognized partners of the FIFA World Cup. Increasing brand presence in North America In recent years, Adidas increased its advertising spending in the United States, which may have been an influencing factor in the resulting increase in North American revenue. Customers' satisfaction increased as well; Adidas had the highest score of customer satisfaction for athletic shoe companies in the U.S., beating out rivals such as Nike and Puma. 
 In 2018, the inflation rate in Ghana amounted to about 9.84 percent compared to the previous year. Ghana’s inflation peaked at almost 17.5 percent in 2016 and is predicted to decrease to 8 percent by 2024. Steady is best for inflation According to economists, a steady inflation rate between two and three percent is desirable to achieve a stable economy in a country. Inflation is the increase in the price level of consumer goods and services over a certain time period. A high inflation rate is often caused by excessive money supply and can turn into hyperinflation, i.e. if inflation occurs too quickly and rapidly, it can devalue currency and cause a recession and even economic collapse. This scenario is currently taking place in Venezuela , for example. The opposite of inflation, the decrease in the price level of goods and services below zero percent, is called deflation. While hyperinflation devalues money, deflation usually increases its value. Both events can damage an economy severely. Is Ghana’s economy at risk? Ghana’s economy is considered quite stable and fast-growing, and is rich in oil, diamonds, and gold. After struggling in the years around 2015 due to increased government spending and plummeting oil prices, it is now on an upswing again. This is also reflected in the decreasing inflation rate, and other key indicators like unemployment and rapid GDP growth support this theory. However, Ghana’s government debt is still struggling with the consequences of the 2015 crisis and forecast to keep skyrocketing during the next few years. 
 Manitoba, one of the three prairie provinces in Canada, was home to the highest cigarette prices in March 2018. Consumers were paying 139.83 Canadian dollars for 200 cigarettes, almost 30 dollars more than the national average retail price of 112.06 dollars for 200 cigarettes in the same month. Consumers could purchase 200 cigarettes for just 96.36 Canadian dollars in Canada’s largest province of Quebec. Why do prices vary regionally? Smoking products are tightly regulated across Canada, with regulations and legal smoking ages varying between provinces. Tobacco taxes can be used to dissuade consumers from purchasing cigarettes, in order to reduce rates of smoking and related diseases. Canadian provinces have their own governmental budgets and, therefore, the power to implement their own tobacco taxes. This creates differences in prices across the country. Future growth in the Canadian tobacco marketRetail sales of tobacco products and supplies have steadily increased year on year, reaching an all-time high of 10.93 billion Canadian dollars in 2017. May 2018 was a milestone month for the industry, with regulatory framework being passed to legalize the manufacturing and sale of vaping products in Canada. Similarly to cigarette retailing, tight regulations will apply to the sale of vaping products and will vary province to province. Almost a third of Canadian consumers were quite familiar with vaping in 2018; this figure, along with retail sales of tobacco products and supplies, is only set to increase. 
 The statistic depicts Greece's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth. In 2018, Greece's real GDP increased by about 1.93 percent compared to the previous year. Greece's national finances Greece is viewed as a high-income economy and experienced high economic and social growth and development between the 1950s and the 1970s, which was the highest rate in the world only behind Japan. However, due to the Great Recession in 2009 as well as the Greek government-debt crisis, Greek experienced severe hits to its already somewhat struggling economy. From the mid to late 2000s, national debt escalated severely but has, since 2012, remained relatively stable, primarily due to several debt restructuring deals as well as stimulus packages from countries within the EU. Different forms of financial aid were offered to Greece from countries within the European Union in order to help maintain the country from going completely dysfunctional to the point that Greece would no longer be able to pay back its debts. Greece’s economy primarily strives in the service sector and benefits exceptionally from its tourist industry. However, due to a failing tourist industry as well as struggles with properly managing imports and exports, struggles within the country are further increasing. More competent leadership, cutting costs as well as new structural reforms are necessary in order to slowly bring Greece back to an economically stable country. 
 The countries with the highest suicide mortality rate worldwide include Lithuania, Russia, Guyana, and South Korea. Suicide rates of men are much higher than among women in many countries. Unsurprisingly, Lithuania, the country with the highest overall suicide rate, has the highest suicide rate for men. However, South Korea reports the highest suicide rate for women, with a significantly higher rate than Japan, the country with the second highest rate for women. In the United States Although the United States is not among the countries with the highest suicide mortality rate, suicide is still one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. As with other countries, the suicide rate among males in the U.S. is much higher than among females. The age group with the highest rate of suicide is those aged 45 to 64 years, followed by 25 to 44-year-olds. The states with the highest suicide rates include Montana, Alaska, Wyoming, and New Mexico. Risk factors and help Major risk factors for suicide include mental health issues and substance abuse problems, however, it can be difficult to predict who is at risk. Warning signs such as talking about wanting to die, expressing feelings of depression, suicidal ideation, and abusing drugs or alcohol should be taken seriously and help should be sought as soon as possible. Suicide hotlines exist in many countries around the world and one should not hesitate to discuss such issues and feelings with a health care provider. 
 Quality of products is always an important factor when it comes to consumption and spending, and many consumers define a certain product’s quality standard by applying specific characteristics - one of those being its origin. Nowadays, Germany is synonymous with high-quality cars, for example, while Switzerland would be known for high-quality clocks or chocolate, and Italy for fine wine. Quality measured In order to make these preferences among consumers visible, the global Made-In-Country Index was conducted - to show how positively products "made in..." are perceived in various countries all over the world. The index is calculated based on each country's average weighted share of positive perception. First rank is set as Index 100. Quality perceived The “Made in” label was introduced in Great Britain in the 19th century to make distinguishing foreign products easier, since foreign manufacturers had taken to labelling their goods with false marks. Most of the products thusly labelled “made in” came from Germany, which is why the “Made in Germany” label gained publicity and became very well-known. While it was not necessarily a label of quality at the time, this perception has been reversed completely: “Made in Germany” is now one of the highest seals a product could receive. 
 In 2018, running, jogging and trail running were the most popular outdoor activities amongst people in the U.S. aged six years and older, accounting for a total of 57.83 million participants.

 The statistic shows the unemployment rate in South Korea from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the unemployment rate in South Korea was at around 3.84 percent. See the figures for the population of South Korea for comparison. Economy of South Korea South Korea is one of the world’s richest countries as well as a member of the G20, an organization made up of the 20 strongest economies in the world. Due to excessive growth from the 1960s to the 1990s, South Korea established itself as a developed country in the world with a strong economy and high wages. Continued economic growth is attributed to a robust export-oriented economy, which was deemed necessary for the country particularly due to a scarcity in natural resources as well as overpopulation in comparison to available living space. During the global financial crisis, South Korea surprised many economists by maintaining a stable economy and even experiencing economic growth, most notably during the peak of the crisis. Through stimulus packages as well as a high level of consumption, South Korea’s strong export-oriented economy was not affected as negatively as many other developed countries. South Korea’s economy primarily revolves around the production and export of technological goods. Some primary exports of the country include electronics, ships and automobiles. South Korea also has some of the largest shipbuilding companies worldwide, which are highly profitable but also have accumulated a rather large sum of debt over the course of several years. 
 The statistic above shows the average single copy price of U.S. magazines from 2000 to 2011. In 2005, the average single copy price of a magazine was 4.40 U.S. dollars. Here you can find data on average magazine circulation per issue. 
 This statistic shows the countries with the highest quality of electricity supply in 2019. That year, Luxembourg had an index score of around 100 and was tied in first with nine other countries. Countries with the highest quality of electricity supply – additional informationIn today’s culture, many people cannot imagine life without electricity. It has become a global necessity and a part of the everyday life of many people. Life without electricity is almost impossible - it can be difficult and slow. The importance of electricity can be seen throughout various fields of human activity: engineering, communication and transport, entertainment, and surgery. We often forget how heavily we rely on electricity, even for small and relatively insignificant activities in our daily lives. The world’s electricity consumption has steadily risen in the last decades from 7.32 trillion kilowatt hours in 1980 to 21.8 trillion kilowatt hours in 2016. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Canada and the United States were the two countries with the highest electricity consumption per capita in 2017. Despite our reliance, many populations suffer from electricity supplies that may be unreliable and/or poor in quality. The number of people who did not have access to electricity is significantly higher in developing Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. More than 260 million people living in India were not connected to the main electricity grid. Even though South Sudan reported a high rate of population growth, it was the country with the lowest access to electricity in 2016. Slightly more than five percent of the population had access to electricity. 
 As of September 2019, MAC Cosmetics was ranked first as the most popular beauty brand on Instagram with 22.6 million followers, and Kylie Cosmetics ranked second with 21.8 million. Instagram is a popular social network for brands to connect with digital audiences, and beauty brands have been making inroads on the platform due to its visual focus and strong presence of social media influencers. Beauty content on social media A picture says more than a thousand words, and millions of pictures are shared on Instagram every day. From meme accounts and people posting vacation snaps to influencers and brands promoting products, the world’s most popular photo sharing platform encompasses a vast range of visual content. Beauty, fashion and food images and videos are some of the more popular and aspirational types of content, drawing huge audiences and user engagement. Brands frequently partner with influencers to address potential shoppers. The tier of influencers considered most effective according to fashion and cosmetics marketing professionals worldwide were in fact micro-influencers with fewer than 100k followers – proof that millions of followers aren’t always necessary to secure brand collaborations. On the other hand, the list of the most followed beauty and fashion influencers reads like a ‘who is who’ of popular models and latest ‘it girls’, currently headed by TV personality and makeup brand owner Kylie Jenner. In 2018, there were 3.7 billion brand-sponsored posts on Instagram and this figure is projected to surpass six billion posts in 2020. Brand profile: Sephora Founded in France in 1969 and acquired by French luxury conglomerate LVMH in 1997, Sephora is one of the most visible personal care and beauty brand stores worldwide. In 2017, the company had 362 stores across the United States and was ranked among the top 100 retailers in the United States in based on revenue. 
 Under Armour is an American sporting goods manufacturer, based in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2019, Under Armour employed about 16,400 people around the world. Under Armour is one of the largest sportswear and sporting goods manufacturers in the world, however it is still far behind Nike and adidas who are the dominating companies within this industry. How does Under Armour compare to other companies within the sportswear and sporting goods industry? The global sportswear industry is a lucrative sector, which is anticipated to continue to grow in the next years. Nike and adidas are two of the world's leading athletic apparel companies and their brand values are on another level in comparison to that of Under Armour. While Under Armour featured on a listing of the largest sportswear employers in 2018, it remains quite distant from the market leaders. Nike employs over 73,000 people worldwide, while adidas has more than 57,000 employees. This shows that both Nike and adidas are significant employers around the world and that Under Armour has still quite a way to go before it reaches such levels. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2019, T-Mobile US had a total of about 86.05 million subscribers. The company’s customer base has more than doubled since 2013. T-Mobile subscriber base T-Mobile's subscriber base can be broken down into three customer categories: branded postpaid customers, branded prepaid customers, and wholesale customers. The majority of T-Mobile's subscribers are postpaid customers, making up more than half of the company’s customer base. About one third of customers are prepaid subscribers with the remaining 20 percent of customers being part of the wholesale segment. Customer satisfaction T-Mobile US currently has the highest customer satisfaction rate amongst wireless service providers in the United States according to the ACSI customer satisfaction index. This is also reflected in the fact that T-Mobile had the highest percentage of wireless customers who would not switch carriers in 2017 and 2018 - of the four major wireless services providers (T-Mobile US, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon). Additionally, T-Mobile's churn rate was at an all-time low in the second quarter of 2019; less than a percent of subscribers ended their T-Mobile subscription at that time. 
 The European Union was the top exporter of fish and fishery products worldwide in 2018, at 38.1 billion U.S. dollars in export value. China came in second at 25 billion U.S. dollars in fish and fishery exports. Global seafood market The global seafood market is projected to reach approximately 155.32 billion U.S. dollars in value by the year 2023, up from about 130 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Though seafood features heavily in the cuisines of many different cultures, the three largest markets for processed fish and seafood worldwide are China, India, and Japan, in descending order. Fish consumption in the U.S. In the United States, seafood is readily available but as a protein source is not quite as popular as meat, eggs, or dairy. Only about 29 percent of Americans consider fish or seafood as main source of protein in their diet. Shrimp was the most popular variety of seafood, with the average U.S. consumer eating around four pounds of shrimp on an annual basis. 
 In 2018, the average inflation rate in Nepal was at 4.15 percent, a slight drop compared to the previous year. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket. This product basket contains products and services on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities, and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. Political and economic turmoil The Nepalese economy is heavily influenced by the country’s political situation. It has made only slow progress in connecting with the global economy and improving the standard of living for its inhabitants but is now finally picking up speed. Nepal’s economy is not stable yet: Inflation is decreasing but all over the place – usually a sure sign of a struggling economy – and GDP growth is also not steady and forecast to decrease again in the future. Additionally, Nepal’s trade deficit seems to be in free fall. Move to the city A quarter of Nepal’s, mostly rural, population is living below the poverty line, but Nepal is working on improving their outlook in the future. Today, agriculture contributes about a third to the country’s GDP, and a sizeable share of commodity exports consists of agricultural products – but already the lion’s share of Nepal’s GDP is generated by the services sector, like tourism and textiles. By shifting GDP generation to services, and consequently creating jobs in the cities and attracting more people to urban areas, Nepal might finally be able to stabilize its economy and provide better living standards for its inhabitants. 
 This statistic gives information on the number of registered users of the chat-app LINE in selected countries as of October 2014. During that month, the Japanese chat app had 33 million users in Indonesia. International chat app Originally developed in Japan in the wake of the Tōhoku earthquake in March 2011, LINE app was created as an online messaging alternative that did not have to rely on Japan’s then-damaged telecommunications structure. The app was released to the public in 2011 and reached 100 million users only 18 months after its initial release. Apart from over-the-top messaging, LINE also offers free voice calls similar to Skype and thus provides an attractive alternative to paid mobile operating services. Furthermore, the app has also integrated social features such as timelines where users can post status messages to contacts. Aside from social networking features, LINE has also released a camera app and a gaming platform, LINE game. The in-app store of LINE enables users to purchase stickers that can be used similarly to emoji in chat discussions or to decorate photographs. LINE’s unique features are particularly popular in its home market Japan and other Asian countries. The company’s aggressive local marketing strategies, such as television commercials in Indonesia or flash sales in Thailand, ensure its continuous dominance of the Asian market. 
 The global eyewear market, which is made up of spectacles, contact lenses, sunglasses, and other eyewear products, was estimated to be worth around 131 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 and was forecast to reach a value of 210.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2025.

 This statistic provides information on the most popular networks worldwide as of January 2020, ranked by number of active accounts. Market leader Facebook was the first social network to surpass 1 billion registered accounts and currently sits at almost 2.45 billion monthly active users. Sixth-ranked photo-sharing app Instagram had 1 billion monthly active accounts. Social networks The leading social networks are usually available in multiple languages and enable users to connect with friends or people across geographical, political or economic borders. Approximately 2 billion internet users are using social networks and these figures are still expected to grow as mobile device usage and mobile social networks increasingly gain traction. The most popular social networks usually display a high number of user accounts or strong user engagement. For example, market leader Facebook was the first social network to surpass 1 billion monthly active users, whereas recent newcomer Pinterest was the fastest independently launched site to reach 10 million unique monthly visitors. The majority of social networks with more than 100 million users originated in the United States, but European services like VK or Chinese social networks Qzone and Renren have also garnered mainstream appeal in their areas due to local context and content. Social network usage by consumers is highly diverse: platforms such as Facebook or Google+ are highly focused on exchanges between friends and family and are constantly pushing interaction through features like photo or status sharing and social games. Other social networks like Tumblr or Twitter are all about rapid communication and are aptly termed microblogs. Some social networks focus on community; others highlight and display user-generated content. Due to a constant presence in the lives of their users, social networks have a decidedly strong social impact. The blurring between offline and virtual life as well as the concept of digital identity and online social interactions are some of the aspects that have emerged in recent discussions. 
 The bitcoin index value for the end of January 2020 amounted to 9,388.88 U.S. dollars. The bitcoin price index is an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges. More information on bitcoin and other crypto-currencies can be found in our Statista Report 2019. Bitcoin – additional information Since the Bitcoin creation in 2009, the price of this virtual currency remained quite stable until January 2013, reaching a maximum value of approximately 20 U.S. dollars. Afterwards a monthly price growth was observed until October 2013 when the price reached 198 U.S. dollars. This nearly tenfold increase in Bitcoin value proved to be insignificant in comparison to the price rally in November 2013, when the threshold of 1,100 U.S. dollars per coin was broken. After a period of downtrend which followed, Bitcoin price reached 1,349.19 U.S. dollars in April 2017. The number of Bitcoins in circulation has grown month on month and amounted to over 17 million in January 2019. The global value of Bitcoin amounted to approximately 66 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 2018 and was much higher than the value of other internet currencies. As of September 2019, there were 5,457 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. In August of that year, the countries with highest number of Bitcoin ATMs were the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Austria, and Spain. There are still many concerns about using Bitcoin for online transactions and the security of this virtual currency is seen as one of the most important factors influencing the decision about the Bitcoin purchase. 
 This statistic illustrates the share of individuals using online banking regularly in Great Britain from 2007 to 2018. Banking and financial services are typically among the first industries to embrace technological advances; starting as far back in time as the appearance of automated teller machines (ATMs) and credit cards. Ever since the first secure Internet systems for financial operations became available on a large scale, accessing of one's bank account online to carry out transactions, pay off credit cards, establish credit lines or invest savings became one of the fastest growing areas of Internet activities. Mobile banking has become the new norm In the UK, online banking use increased during the period under observation: already 30 percent of respondents reported accessing their bank account online within three months prior to the survey in 2007. The growth in this activity area was steady over time, and the share rose to 69 percent of individuals who used online banking regularly as of 2018. In terms of device use for online banking, the smartphone was the preferred method. Further digital banking advancements joined online banking solution in recent years: the current growth is noted in the areas of mobile banking, mobile banking apps, digital wallet and Fintech solutions directed to individual users. Online banking in Europe Across Europe, the variation in the online banking penetration is huge. As of 2018, Nordic countries including Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden all had online banking penetration rates of over 80 percent. In stark contrast, North Macedonia, Romania and Bulgaria had penetration rates lower than 10 percent.

 In the last measured quarter, The Walt Disney Company generated 20.86 billion U.S. dollars in revenue. Disney's first fiscal quarter of 2020 was a strong one, which the company partially attributed to the success of its new streaming service, Disney Plus (stylized as Disney+). The Walt Disney Company: financial dataDisney's quarterly net income often varies wildly throughout each fiscal year, sometimes surpassing four or five billion U.S. dollars and other times dipping below one billion. As far as revenue is concerned, the company's most lucrative areas are by far its media networks and parks, experiences, and products segments, though its direct-to-consumer and international segment is growing and has been known to surpass its studio entertainment segment when it comes to revenue. The Walt Disney Company announced record revenue of 69.57 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, an increase of over 10 billion U.S. dollars on the figure recorded in the previous year, which had formerly been the company's best year yet in that regard.

 The statistic shows the inflation rate in France from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket. This product basket contains products and services on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. In 2018, the inflation rate in France was at about 2.1 percent compared to the previous year. The economy of France France is among the top six of the countries with the largest gross domestic product worldwide, behind the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, China and the United States. It is thus one of the leading economies worldwide. Its economy mostly relies on the services sector with almost 80 percent, agriculture making up only 1 percent of the economy and the industry sector the rest. These three sectors are typically seen as the main pillars of a country’s economy. France is also among the leading exporting countries worldwide and the leading importing countries worldwide. Both France’s exports and imports have increased over the last few years. Its trade balance (a country’s exports minus its imports) has been decreasing significantly over the last decade, which means the value of France’s exports was considerably lower than the value of its imports. France’s main exports include wine, meat and other food products. Its main imports are manufactured goods, among other products. As for the national finances, the national debt of France has been rising steadily and it is thus counted among the countries with the highest public debt, albeit lower in the ranking. Nevertheless, the standard of living in France is quite high, its life expectancy is among the highest in the world, and the employment rate has been steady, or even rising slightly, since 2009. 
 Iran’s inflation rate rose sharply to 30.49 percent in 2018 and was projected to rise another six percentage points before slowly starting to decline. Given the recent sanctions by the United States regarding the nuclear deal, this number has both political and economic implications. Political implications President Hassan Rouhani won the 2017 election based on economic promises, many stemming from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. Lifting these sanctions opened the Iranian economy to many opportunities, including the chance to benefit from increased oil exports. The JCPOA was an integral part of the Rouhani campaign, so any economic hardship that is linked to the deal will likely be blamed on the president. Economic implications High inflation leads to high interest rates, which leads to less borrowing. Less borrowing means less investment, which slows economic growth. This slower growth often leads to higher inflation, which is what economists call an inflationary spiral. As such, Iran will have difficulty achieving substantial GDP growth until inflation returns to manageable rates. 
How many households are in the U.S.? In 2019, there were 128.58 million households in the United States. This is a significant increase from 1960, when there were 52.8 million households in the U.S. What counts as a household? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a household is considered to be all persons living within one housing unit. This includes apartments, houses, or single rooms, and consists of both related and unrelated people living together. For example, two roommates who share a living space but are not related would be considered a household in the eyes of the Census. It should be noted that group living quarters, such as college dorms, are not counted as households in the Census. Household changes While the population of the United States has been increasing, the average size of households in the U.S. has decreased since 1960. In 1960, there was an average of 3.33 people per household, but in 2018, this figure had decreased to 2.53 people per household. Additionally, two person households make up the majority of American households, followed closely by single-person households.

How many criminal homicides were there in the U.S.? In 2018, there were 16,214 reported cases of murder or non-negligent manslaughter in the United States. This figure has decreased since 1991, when there were 24,700 reported murder and non-negligent manslaughter cases. Murder vs. Manslaughter While it is can be easy to confuse the two terms, murder and nonnegligent manslaughter are two different crimes. While there is some variation from state to state, murder is usually seen as having some planning or forethought involved in the crime, while manslaughter is considered to be a “crime of passion,” with the absence of forethought. Courts tend to differentiate between the states of mind of the accused when bringing manslaughter or murder charges against them. The victims In 2017, there were far more male murder victims than female murder victims, with Black victims making up a large proportion of the total number of victims. Additionally, many murders are perpetrated by either an acquaintance of the victim or a stranger.

 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Canadian dollar (EUR CAD), according to the data provided by the European Central Bank, starting from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until the 2019. This is the average, or standardized, measure; it denotes a calculation of average based on many observations throughout the period in question. It is different to the concrete (point in time) measure. The second one is used to show the exchange rate as it looked like in a specific point in time, for example at end of the month or end of the year, at closing. Between years 2009 and 2012, the exchange rate noted a sharp decline in value, with the annual average exchange rate of the euro to the Canadian dollar falling 1.59 to 1.29 by 2012. This meant that one euro could buy 1.29 Canadian dollars. This sharp decline was most likely associated with the volatile changes brought to the financial markets by the global recession. Since 2012, the annual average euro to Canadian dollar exchange rate has recovered to the level of 1.49 as of 2019; however it remains to be lower, compared to 1999, the first year of the observation. 
 In February 2019, it was found that 38 percent of adults in the United States aged between 18 and 29 years used Twitter. This age group was the microblogging service’s biggest audience in the United States, followed by a 27 percent usage reach among 30 to 49-year-olds. Twitter users in the United States As of the first quarter of 2019, Twitter had 68 million monthly active users in the United States. During the same period, the number of monetizable daily active Twitter users in the country amounted to 28 million. As of April 2019, 56 percent of U.S. Twitter audiences were male and 44 percent were female. According to a November 2018 survey of social media users in the United States, Twitter was the most popular social network for news consumption. Twitter usage in the United States Twitter is popular among users looking to catch up and chime in on current and trending topics and live-tweet about events and media. Live-tweeting television series or sporting events is a popular user activity and in 2018, the most popular television series based on average number of Twitter interactions per episode was ABC’s ‘The Bachelor’. In terms of global sporting events, it does not get much bigger than the Olympic Games. During the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang 2018, Twitter accounted for 50 percent of stakeholder posts during the Winter. 
 Net loss attributable to Tesla’s common stockholders was 862 million U.S. dollars in 2019. In the same year, the California-based company burnt through a total of about 775 million U.S. dollars of cash. Focus on innovation drives costs Net losses began to accelerate in 2014 and peaked in 2017. Between 2014 and 2019, Tesla’s research and development (R&D) expenses increased by a staggering 189 percent from about 465 milion to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. Tesla's R&D expenses decreased by eight percent between 2018 and 2019. In 2017 and 2018, the company had an R&D intensity of 12 and 7 percent, respectively. This was largely due to the focus on innovative technologies, including electric vehicle batteries and charging infrastructure. However, the company had to invest significantly more capital than expected towards ramping up production of its new Model 3. As a result of increasing demand for Model 3 batteries, Tesla has also begun pouring money into a Gigafactory plant in Shanghai. Cost improvement trend Tesla's selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses jumped from 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 to more than 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in the following year. SG&A expenses increased moderately by to reach 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 and 2.65 billion U.S. dollars the most recent fiscal year, indicating that Tesla has managed to put a halt to rising SG&A costs.

The total production of milled rice worldwide amounted to about 481.1 million metric tons that year. 
 Major League Baseball has a minimum player salary in place to ensure that its athletes are fairly compensated for the work they do. The MLB minimum salary in 2019 stood at a handsome 555 thousand U.S. dollars annually, representing a steady increase each year over the last 15 years. Money to be made in the MLB MLB players are known to receive generous yearly salaries, in addition to performance incentives, such as prizes for games won. The average player salary in 2019 was more than seven times higher than the minimum salary, at around 4.36 million U.S. dollars. This also represents almost double the average player salary from 2003, illustrating the rapid boom of money in baseball. However, there are large descrepancies between the salaries offered to players by different franchises. While players at the San Francisco Giants can expect to take home an average of 7.38 million U.S. dollars annually, professionals for the Oakland Athletics have to settle with just 2.09 million U.S. dollars a year on average. MLB's biggest earners Certain positions in the MLB, such as first base or starting pitcher, are usually better paid due to the important roles they are considered to have in the game. The highest paid players in the MLB in the 2019 season include Washington Nationals’ pitcher, Stephen Strasburg, and Arizona Diamondbacks’s pitcher, Zack Greinke, with an annual salary of over 34 million U.S. dollars each. In 2019, the Boston Red Sox were the best-paid baseball team in the MLB as the famous franchise based at Fenway Park had an opening day payroll of 213.19 million U.S. dollars. The Miami Marlins, on the other hand, were the most thrifty franchise with an opening day payroll of just under 63 million U.S. dollars. 
 In 2018, the infant mortality rate in India was at about 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, a significant decrease from previous years. Infant mortality as an indicator The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 live births. This rate is an important key indicator for a country’s health and standard of living; a low infant mortality rate indicates a high standard of healthcare. Causes of infant mortality include premature birth, sepsis or meningitis, sudden infant death syndrome, and pneumonia. Globally, the infant mortality rate has shrunk from 63 infant deaths per 1,000 live births to 27 since 1990 and is forecast to drop to 8 infant deaths per 1,000 live births by the year 2100. India’s rural problem With 32 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, India is neither among the countries with the highest nor among those with the lowest infant mortality rate. Its decrease indicates an increase in medical care and hygiene, as well as a decrease in female infanticide. Increasing life expectancy at birth is another indicator that shows that the living conditions of the Indian population are improving. Still, India’s inhabitants predominantly live in rural areas, where standards of living as well as access to medical care and hygiene are traditionally lower and more complicated than in cities. Public health programs are thus put in place by the government to ensure further improvement. 
 This statistic depicts the price of rare earth oxide neodymium oxide globally from 2009 to 2025. It is expected that the price of neodymium oxide will reach some 94,438 U.S. dollars per metric ton in 2017. Until 2025, the price is expected to increase over 148 thousand dollars per metric ton. 
 The statistic shows the growth rate in the real GDP in the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the rate of GDP growth in the United Kingdom was at around 1.4 percent compared to the previous year.The economy of the United Kingdom GDP is used an indicator as to the shape of a national economy. It is one of the most regularly called upon measurements regarding the economic fitness of a country. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced in a country within a given period of time, usually a year. Inflation adjusted real GDP figures serve as an even more telling indication of a country’s economic state in that they act as a more reliable and clear tool as to a nation’s economic health. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in the United Kingdom has started to level in recent years after taking a huge body blow in the financial collapse of 2008. The UK managed to rise from the state of dark desperation it was in between 2009 and 2010, from -3.97 to 1.8 percent. The country suffered acutely from the collapse of the banking industry, raising a number of questions within the UK with regards to the country’s heavy reliance on revenues coming from London's financial sector, arguably the most important in the world and one of the globe’s financial command centers. Since the collapse of the post-war consensus and the rise of Thatcherism, the United Kingdom has been swept along in a wave of individualism - collective ideals have been abandoned and the mass privatisation of the heavy industries was unveiled - opening them up to market competition and shifting the economic focus to that of service. The Big Bang policy, one of the cornerstones of the Thatcher government programs of reform, involved mass and sudden deregulation of financial markets. This led to huge changes in the way the financial markets in London work, and saw the many old firms being absorbed by big banks. This, one could argue, strengthened the UK financial sector greatly and while frivolous and dangerous practices brought the sector into great disrepute, the city of London alone brings in around one fifth of the countries national income making it a very prominent contributor to wealth in the UK. 
 This statistic depicts the volume of crude oil imported into China in 2014, by source country. That year, some nine percent of China's oil imports came from Iran. China's crude oil imports China’s emergence as one of the world’s major powerhouses has fueled the country’s thirst for energy and turned it into one of the world’s largest crude oil net importers. The large increase in China’s oil imports has been heavily driven by economic growth and consumption rates that are rising above production rates. Its role as a top net oil importer is expected to be sustained in the near future. China is one of the largest petroleum consumers in the world, behind the United States. China has surpassed the United States as the world's largest net importer of petroleum. Lower production rates from countries like Libya and Sudan encouraged China to replace these imports with crude oil from countries like Oman, Russia, and Venezuela. China, itself, extracted 16.58 million tons of crude oil in March 2017. As of 2015, China produced 4.31 million barrels of oil a day domestically, while consuming approximately 11.97 million barrels daily. Approximately 2.5 billion metric tons of oil reserves in the country were known and economically viable as of 2015. As an alternative to fossil fuels, China is heavily investing in renewable energy sources, and became the largest renewable energy investment market in the past years, when the largest funding volumes were devoted to projects within the wind and solar energy industries. 
 In 2019, over 50 percent of EU citizens voted in the European parliamentary elections, the highest voter turnout since 1994, when it was 56 percent. The highest turnout occurred in the first set of European parliamentary elections, held in 1979, in which 61.99 percent of eligible Europeans voted. Voter turnout declined in every election subsequent election however, reaching a low of 42.61 percent in 2014. Traditional parties maintain their majority in 2019 Although they run for national political parties during elections, European members of parliament are grouped into large pan-European political groups when they sit in the European Parliament. In the 2019 Elections the group that won the most seats was the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) which won 180 seats, followed by the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) which won 146 seats. Populist parties win big in Italy, France and the UK In three of the European Union’s largest countries, right-wing populist parties won the most seats in the European elections of 2019. In the United Kingdom the newly formed Brexit party led by Nigel Farage won 29 of the UK’s 73 seats in the European parliament, while in France Marine le Pen’s National Rally won 22 seats out of a possible 74. The League party in Italy, led by Matteo Salvini, managed to win 28 seats in Italy, an increase of 23 when compared with their performance in 2014.

 The graph shows the inflation rate in China from January 2019 to January 2020. In January 2020, the inflation rate in China ranged at 5.4 percent. The term inflation means the devaluation of money caused by a permanent increase of the price level for products such as consumer or investment goods. For comparison, inflation in India amounted to 3.43 percent as of 2018.Inflation rate in China – additional information The Inflation rate is most commonly measured by the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index shows the price development for private expenses and shows the current level of inflation when increasing. A positive inflation rate reflects a rise in prices. Between 2007 and 2018, China only once experienced a deflation situation, with price levels decreasing by roughly 0.7 percent in 2009. Monthly inflation in China between August 2018 and August 2019 was moderate compared to other emerging markets. In 2018, the monthly inflation rates of Brazil, Russia and India ranged from 2.2 percent to 5.5 percent, while in China the figures were between 1.5 percent and 2.8 percent. Only from October 2018 on, inflation in China began to exceed 3 percent. In China, there is a regional difference in inflation rates. As of December 2019, Hainan province experienced the highest CPI at 106.5 percent, while Ningxia reported a CPI growth of 2.8 percent. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, as of December 2019, inflation was mainly fuelled by a surge in food sector prices, as they had increased by 12.9 percent compared to previous year. The price gain in other non-food sectors was relatively slight. Transportation and communication prices even decreased by 0.7 percent compared with the year before. Low inflation might be good news for consumers and businesses, but it also indicates slower expansion of the economy. As stated in research by IMF, GDP growth momentum in China has cooled down since 2010. With a population of about 1.4 billion people, China outpaced Japan as the world’s second-biggest economy in 2010. According to a forecast by Goldman Sachs, China’s GDP will amount to about 32 trillion U.S. dollars in 2030, surpassing the United States as the world’s leading economic power. 
 In 2018, the estimated inflation rate in Bangladesh amounted to about 5.61 percent compared to the previous year. For the next few years, inflation in Bangladesh is forecast to decrease to around 5.5. percent. Up-and-coming Bangladesh Bangladesh is a mixed economy on the rise, with a soaring gross domestic product (GDP) and steady economic growth. While its unemployment has increased slightly since 2010, it seems to rest comfortably below the 4.4-percent mark. Employment is shifting from agriculture to services – the main GDP generator of the country. One of the Next Eleven Bangladesh is a fast-growing emerging economy and a member of the so-called Next Eleven – eleven nations with promising economic developments that puts them almost on eye level with the four BRIC states. Both terms were coined by economist Jim O’Neill and describe the major emerging economies today, taking aspects like macroeconomic stability, openness of trade, and standard of living into account. Other members of the Next Eleven are Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, and Nigeria, among others. 
 This statistic shows the world's leading cotton producing countries in crop year 2018/2019. In that year, cotton production in India amounted to around 5.77 million metric tons. Cotton production in the world Cotton is a natural plant fiber which grows around the seed of the cotton plant. Fibers are used in the textile industry, where they are the starting point of the production chain. First, the cotton fiber is obtained from the cotton plant and then spun into yarn. From there, the cotton yarn is woven or knitted into fabric.The use of cotton has a long tradition in the clothing industry due to its desirable characteristics. Cloths made of this fiber are moisture-absorbent, have a good drape and are known for their long durability. Consumers continue to purchase large amounts of cotton products as they prefer cotton’s light and comfortable qualities. Products made out of cotton range from highly absorbent bath towels over bed linens to basic clothes such as t-shirts, underwear or socks. The top cotton producing countries include China, India and the United States respectively. Within the United States, the Southern states traditionally harvest the largest quantities of cotton. This region was formerly known as the ‘Cotton Belt’, where cotton was the predominant cash crop from the 18th to the 20th century. Due to soil depletion and social and economic changes, cotton production has declined and acres in this region are now mainly used for crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat. 
 This statistic depicts the total number of retail prescriptions filled annually in the United States from 2013 to 2025. It is estimated that in 2019, 4.38 billion retail prescriptions will be filled throughout the United States.U.S. Pharmacies and Drug Stores IndustryThe retail drug industry is comprised of pharmacies or drugstores, as they are known in North America. According to Statista estimates, which were calculated based on numbers presented by IBIS World, pharmacies and drugstores in the United States will generate a revenue of 257 billion U.S. dollars in 2014. With an aging population and greater prevalence of chronic diseases, the need for safe, legal pharmaceutical drugs is constantly rising.Pharmacies and drug stores dispense prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs directly to patients. However, their role is more than one of simple distribution as they dispense medication in specific doses, adhere to optimal conditions of storage and give valuable advice to patients. Pharmacies practice in a wide range of locations such as communities, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. Other drug retail outlets include supermarkets, and independent and online pharmacies, which offer mail-order drugs to patients, proving especially convenient for those that may be unable to leave their homes. In 2016, CVS Health was the leading drug store chain in the United States, based on retail prescription sales, generating approximately 60.8 billion U.S. dollars. Apart from selling drugs, miscellaneous products also account for a percentage of sales for these retail outlets, such as cosmetics and confectioneries.The retail drug store industry employs many different types of workers. Each store has a manager, along with department managers or assistant managers to handle additional administrative duties. Sales associates are generally entry-level retail workers. Pharmacists require a specialized degree and licensing to dispense medication. 
 The graph shows Toyota’s R&D costs from FY 2007 to FY 2018. Toyota incurred R&D costs of about one trillion Japanese yen in FY 2019. Japan-based Toyota Motor Corporation ranks among the largest automobile manufacturers in the world. Toyota’s research and development expenses Not only is the Toyota Motor Corporation Japan’s largest automotive manufacturer, it is also ranked as the number one carmaker worldwide in terms of automobile production. Japan had the highest public debt in relation to GDP in 2017. The weak yen has clearly helped Toyota export more vehicles: The Aichi-based carmaker exported a staggering 159,760 passenger cars in March 2018 alone. However, the company was hit hard by the 2008/2009 worldwide financial crisis, and its research and development expenses hit rock bottom in the fiscal year of 2010, only to finally reach pre-crisis levels in the fiscal year of 2014. In 2018, Toyota was among the top 20 companies with the highest spending on research and development. 
 In 2018, the total population of Singapore was approximately 5.64 million inhabitants. Population growth in the country is slow and even dropped below one percent the same year. The youth is fadingSingapore’s population is getting older, with the age bracket of those aged 65 and older getting bigger every year. At the same time, both the share of the younger age brackets, the 0-14 year-olds and the 15-64 year-olds, are decreasing. The median age of the Singaporeans is increasing rapidly, from 34.1 years in the year 2000 to an estimated 42.4 by 2020, with no slowdown in sight. The old are here to stay The majority of Singaporeans are between 25 and 60 years old. In the years to come, improving healthcare and one of the highest life expectancies at birth will see this majority shift to the elderly. Additionally, Singapore’s fertility rate - the average number of children born per woman of childbearing age - is the lowest worldwide and below the replacement rate, which means that Singapore’s population is not only getting older, but also smaller in numbers in the future. This trend could have economic consequences, like decreasing GDP growth and increasing old-age dependency. 
 This statistic shows the average net profit margin of the global mining industry represented by the top forty mining companies worldwide, from 2002 to 2018. In 2011, the net profit margin of the mining industry's leading companies was approximately 24 percent. Seven years later, in 2018, the net profit margin stood at ten percent. The net profit margin (also known as profit margin, net margin, net profit ratio) is a measurement to describe the profitability of a company. It is calculated by dividing the net income by the total revenue (or net profit by sales). For 2018, it means that the top 40 mining companies kept ten cents of profit out of every U.S. dollar they earned. Profits of top mining companies The average net profit margin of the world’s top 40 mining companies stood at some seven percent in 2014, but decreased to negative seven percent in 2015, and then rebounded to ten percent in 2018. These figures are a distinct decrease when compared to the years before. For example, in 2010, the profit margin stood at around 25 percent among the global top 40 mining firms. In 2018, the top 40 mining companies generated a net profit of approximately 66 billion U.S. dollars. As of that year, the company with the highest market capitalization was Austrialian/British mining giant BHP Billiton. The global top 40 mining companies, which represent the vast majority of the industry, generated more than half a trillion U.S. dollars of revenue in 2018. In terms of quantity, these companies produce most of all coal (including thermal and metallurgical coal), iron ore, and bauxite. 
 In 2018, Nokia had 103 thousand employees, situated in over 130 locations throughout the world, with over 40 thousand each in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region including China (ID 1021756, new stat). In comparison, Nokia’s net revenue was largest in Europe at 6.8 billion euros, and second to that was North America with almost 6.6 billion euros, where about 10 percent of Nokia’s employees are located. 22 percent of Nokia’s workforce is comprised of women, similar to competitor Ericsson, which has 23 percent of its workforce made up of women employees. Returning to Profitability The Finnish company has transitioned from producing cellular devices to network equipment, a shift that is accompanied by ongoing cost-saving initiatives. One of Nokia’s cost-cutting strategies is layoffs, including 350 jobs in its home country of Finland, out of the 6000 employees based there. The company hopes to save 700 million euros in annual costs over 2019 and 2020. In total Nokia currently spends more than six billion euros annually on salaries and wages.Smartphone manufacturer moves to 5G Nokia has undergone several directional changes throughout the last few decades. Once a successful phone manufacturer in the early 2000s, the company struggled with increasingly overwhelming competition from Apple and Samsung. One reason for Nokia’s declining share within the mobile phone market was remaining committed to their own mobile operating system Symbian (OS) for too long before switching to Google’s Android OS. After an unsuccessful partnership with Microsoft in 2013 - Nokia sold its mobile and devices segment to Microsoft the following year - the company turned its focus to network infrastructure. In recent years, Nokia has invested a lot into the research and development of 5G cellular network technology. 
 This graph shows the countries and regions with the highest number of fatal civil airliner accidents from 1945 through December 4, 2019. At 854, the United States is the country with the highest number of fatal civil airliner accidents. According to the source, military accidents, corporate jets, hijackings (and other criminal occurrences) are not included in the statistic. Plane crashes As a result of continued annual growth in global air traffic passenger demand, the number of airplanes that are involved in accidents is on the increase. Although the United States is ranked among the 20 countries with the highest quality of air infrastructure, the U.S. also reports the highest number of civil airliner accidents worldwide. In terms of fatal accidents, it seems that aviation safety experienced some decline on a couple of parameters, however, air transportation is still the safest way of travel. There were 0.39 jet hull losses per one million flights in 2016, up from 0.32 jet hull losses per one million flights in 2015 and higher than the five-year period rate 2011-2015 of 0.36 hull loss accidents per million jet flights. Just under 90 percent of all fatal crashes occurred in Africa and Asia in 2012. That year, North America reported 29 accidents, none of which were fatal. There were 90 accidents in scheduled commercial air transport in total in 2013. Regarding the total number of accidents, 2012 experienced a 21 percent year-over-year decrease from 2011, while air traffic remained relatively stable over the same period. The year 2014 is memorable in the aviation’s safety performance for the tragic disappearance of Malaysia Airlines’ flight MH370 and the shooting down of MH17, which lead to 298 fatalities. However, the number of fatal accidents among all aircraft types is lower, only 12 accidents occurred in 2014 compared to 17 in 2013. In 2015, only four fatal accidents were recorded, all of them involving turboprop aircraft and resulted in 136 fatalities. In that year more than 3.5 billion people were transported safely on 37.6 million flights. Nonetheless, the tragic Germanwings air crash in March 2015 and Metrojet’s deliberate attack in October 2015 have sparked fresh concerns over airline safety. 
 The revenue of IBM reached more than 77 billion U.S. dollars in the 2019 fiscal year, showing a trend of declining revenue over the past eight years since 2011, when IBM’s revenue peaked at a record 106.9 billion U.S. dollars. Despite the declining revenues over the past few years, IBM is still one of the most valuable technology brands in the world behind only Google, Apple, Microsoft, Tencent, and Facebook. IBM’s response to a shifting market A tech giant since the nineties, IBM has faced struggles adjusting to changes in the marketplace. Recently the company has focused on what it terms “strategic imperatives”: getting rid of low-margin businesses and investing in high-margin businesses; at the end of 2018, for example, IBM sold IBM WebSphere Commerce to HCL Technologies for 1.8 billion U.S. dollars. IBM is still very profitable, although not at the level as between 2006 and 2012. Reflecting the changing demands of digital transformation, the largest source of IBM’s revenue for fiscal year 2019 now comes from its technology services and cloud platforms business segment, which specializes in helping organizations integrate their traditional infrastructure into a multicloud environment. 
 This statistic shows the American customer satisfaction index scores of Starbucks in the United States from 2006 to 2019. Starbucks had an ACSI score of 79 in 2019. Starbucks The Starbucks Corporation is a coffeehouse chain based in Seattle which operates more than 29 thousand stores worldwide (as of 2018). Starbucks, which became a publicly traded company on June 26, 1992, generated nearly 25 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in the 2018 fiscal year. In its company-operated stores Starbucks generates 74 percent of revenue from the sale of beverages, 20 percent from food sales and two percent from the sale of packaged and single serve coffees. Another four percent of retail sales are attributable to coffee-making equipment and other merchandise. The United States is Starbucks’ biggest and most important market. In 2018, revenues from Starbucks Americas segment amounted to more than 16 billion U.S. dollars. The Americas segment comprises over 13,000 stores in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Brazil Chile and other American countries with around 86 percent of those stores located in the United States. Starbucks’ main competitors are quick-service restaurants and specialty coffee shops such as McDonald’s with it McCafé brand, Caribou Coffee or Dunkin’ Donuts. Since the coffee shop market is segmented and fragmented to varying degrees Starbucks faces differing competitors depending on the country / region of operation. In Canada for example the fast casual restaurant chain Tim Hortons, which operates around 4,000 stores in Canada compared to Starbucks' 1,109, is one of Starbucks’ strongest competitors.

 This statistic shows the unemployment rate in the United States from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate among the United States population ranged at approximately 3.87 percent. Employment and economy in the United States The most notable surge in unemployment in the United States occurred between 2008 and 2009, and peaked in 2010. The United States was one of the countries most severely affected by the global financial crisis, primarily due to the crash originally materializing in the country. The crisis had a considerable effect on American households, most prominently on the labor market, which was also met with a significant decline in the stock market as well as the housing market. In order to stabilize and maintain a healthy economy, the United States government was inclined to absorb debt. The country’s national debt had increased yearly, however surged most remarkably in 2009 and has almost doubled in roughly 6 years since the crash. In order to determine if a country is able to pay back debt, the so-called debt-to-GDP ratio is used. It is often expressed as a percentage - the lower the percentage, the more likely a country can pay back debts without absorbing further debt. The United States’ debt-to-GDP ratio correspondingly began increasing in 2008, after experiencing an annual decline in the years prior, and is continuing to increase. Additionally, the United States maintained a budget deficit over the past decade, implying that its expenditures are higher than its revenues. This value has however significantly declined since 2009. 
 This statistic contains data on the total assets of the Walt Disney Company from the fiscal year 2006 to the fiscal year 2019. In 2019, the Walt Disney Company held assets worth a total of over 193.98 billion U.S. dollars. In the same year, the American media company generated global revenue of 69.57 billion U.S. dollars, marking the highest figure to-date. Of this revenue generated in 2019, 24.8 million U.S. dollars was in the media networks segment and over 26.2 million was generated through the company's parks and resorts. The Walt Disney Company - additional information In 1928, brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney had their first mainstream success when they launched Steamboat Willie, the third cartoon to feature Mickey Mouse and one of the first cartoons in the United States to feature synchronized sound. Their studio, which would become The Walt Disney Company and one of the most recognizable companies in the world, started expanding a year later, to include the Mickey Mouse Club, the Walt Disney Enterprises merchandise division, as well as two other subsidiaries - Disney Film Recording Company and Liled Realty and Investment Company. Although the brand is famous around the world, North America is the company’s most profitable market, with an operating income of 11.41 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 alone. The company also reported 12.6 billion U.S. dollars in global net income in 2018. Disney’s operations are presently divided into five distinct segments: Studio Entertainment, Parks and Resorts, Disney Consumer Products, Media Networks, and Disney Interactive. The media networks division is its largest segment, having reported revenues amounting to 24.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. The segment includes television properties such as Disney–ABC Television Group, Disney Channels Worldwide (Radio Disney and Disney Television Animation), the sports-related channel ESPN and the online video service Hulu. The company owns or holds stakes in hundreds of other companies in the United States and internationally, including publishing houses, various film studios and distribution companies, national and local TV stations, cruise lines, theme parks and web portals. 
 Monaco is the country with the highest median age in the world. The population has a median age of around 53 years, which is around six years more than in Japan and Germany – the other countries that make up the top three. Southern European countries make up a large part of the top 20, with Italy, Slovenia, Greece, San Marino, Andorra, and Croatia all making the list. Low infant mortality means higher life expectancy Monaco and Japan also have the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, which contributes to the calculation of a higher life expectancy because fewer people are dying in the first years of life. Indeed, many of the nations with a high median age also feature on the list of countries with the highest average life expectancy, such as San Marino, Japan, Italy, and Lichtenstein. Demographics of islands and small countries Many smaller countries and island nations have populations with a high median age, such as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, which are both island territories within the British Isles. An explanation for this could be that younger people leave to seek work or education opportunities, while others choose to relocate there for retirement. 
 In 2019, the Canadian territory of Nunavut had the highest unemployment rate in Canada. That year, Nunavut had a 13.4 percent unemployment rate. In comparison, Yukon had the lowest unemployment rate at 3.6 percent. Nunavut Nunavut is the largest and most northern province of Canada. Their economy is powered by many industries which include mining, oil, gas, hunting, fishing, and transportation. They have a high amount of mineral resources and many of their jobs come from mining, however, the territory still suffers from a high unemployment rate, which has fluctuated since 2004. The lack of necessary education, skills, and mobility are all factors that play a part in unemployment. Most of the population identifies as Inuit. Their official languages include English, French, and several Inuit languages. The capital is Iqaluit, which is their largest community and only city. The climate in Nunavut is a polar climate due to its high latitude, and as a result, it rarely goes above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Unemployment in Canada The unemployment rate in Canada has been decreasing since 2009, when it hit a high of 8.3 percent. Since 2006, landed immigrants have faced higher unemployment rates compared to those born in Canada. Youth unemployment in Canada has fluctuated since 1998, but has always remained in the double digits. Additionally, the average duration of unemployment in Canada in 2019 was about 16.7 weeks.

 The BBC News TV channel has seen a decline in reach over recent years in the United Kingdom. In the second quarter of 2019, there were just over 18 million viewers. Five years previously, the number of viewers stood at 25 million. Number one for news? According to a 2019 survey, a quarter of adults in England use the BBC News channel for news. However, it’s not the most commonly used news source. BBC One was used by 58 percent of respondents, and 38 percent used ITV. The third most used news source in England in 2019 was the social media service Facebook. What about the most popular TV channel generally? The most popular television channel in the UK, as of September 2019, was Channel 4 with a 77 percent positivity rating. The second most popular channel was BBC One with 76 percent, and then ITV came in third with 70 percent. 
 This graph shows the civilian labor force participation rate in the United States from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, about 63.1 percent of the American population, eligible to work, participated in the job market. 
 The average domestic heating oil price in Canada reached about 1,160 Canadian dollars per 1,000 liters in November 2019. There are three types of middle distillate fuel oils that can be used for liquid-fuel-burning equipment without any preheating, and three other types that require preheating as they contain residual fuel components. There are both federal and provincial regulations that are applicable to heating oils in Canada, including the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Oil vs natural gas heating Most houses in North America use a central furnace for space heating. In gas or oil fueled furnaces, the fuel is mixed with air and burned. However, most of Canada’s residential space heating is fueled by natural gas, especially as many new homeowners switch out oil heat furnaces in favor of natural gas equipment. Despite the common transition towards natural gas, heating oil tends to burn hotter than natural gas and thus, efficiently heats spaces in a much shorter time. Oil furnaces tend to last much longer than natural gas furnaces. 
 This statistic shows the total population of Italy from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the total population of Italy was around 60.48 million people. See Switzerland's population figures for comparison. The largest city in Italy, with the largest amount of inhabitants, is Rome, with almost 3 million inhabitants. Population of Italy Although the population in Italy has continuously grown year over year, population growth has significantly slowed down since 2004. It can be assumed that a decrease in population growth is related to a decrease in immigrants, especially considering that the fertility rate in the country has remained relatively stable over the past decade. A decrease in immigrants and a potential increase in emigrations could, in return, be a result of the country’s slumping economy. Many aspects of Italy’s economy have suffered as a result of the 2008 financial crisis: Italy’s unemployment rate has increased severely, most notably between 2011 and 2012 and this trend is expected to continue over the next several years. Additionally, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) has since decreased and has struggled to maintain stability. This is most evident in Italy’s real GDP growth rate. Not only is the growth rate minimal, but Italy has also experienced several years of negative growth, especially in 2009. However, despite a struggling economy, the standard of living in Italy has remained affluent. In 2012, Italy was ranked as one of the 30 countries with the highest Human Development Index rating. The Human Development Index, also known as the HDI, is based on values of life expectancy at birth, literacy rate, education levels and gross national income per capita. Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in the world as of 2011, ranking 6th out of the top 20 countries. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2019, Facebook's net income amounted to almost 7.35 billion U.S. dollars. This represents a return to form from the first two quarters of 2019, where the company's net income was less than 3 billion U.S. dollars respectively. This is largely related to legal expenses regarding a FTC matter and settlements in the United States. Facebook’s most recent annual net income amounted to 22 billion U.S. dollars. Facebook company information Facebook is the biggest social network worldwide. The platform generates the vast majority of its revenues through advertising – as of the beginning of 2019, 98 percent of Facebook’s revenues were derived from ad sales, making the company highly dependent on market regulations regarding digital ad sales. As of 2018, Facebook was second only to Google in terms of digital advertising revenues. The company’s ad revenue during this period amounted to 55 billion U.S. dollars. Facebook is still among the fastest-growing tech companies in the world. In 2018, the company increased its revenue by 37 percent, ahead of Netflix and Amazon. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also ranks among the richest internet billionaires with a personal net worth of over 62 billion U.S. dollars. 
 Video gaming is no longer a hobby exclusively enjoyed by the young. As generations have grown up with video games a normal part of life, the age of the average gamer also increases. While 40 percent of video game players still come from the 18 to 35 age demographic, some 21 percent are 50 years and older. Time spent gaming In 2018, Americans aged between 15 to 19 years spent 49 minutes on gaming or leisurely computer use during an average weekday, and more than 90 minutes doing so during weekends or holidays. The age demographic which devoted the least amount of time to gaming was the 45 to 54 years category. Members of this age demographic spent an average of just 10 minutes playing on the computer during the week and only 22 minutes during weekends and holidays. In a further survey, some 11.6 percent of respondents in the U.S. admitted to playing video games for more than 20 hours a week, while another 11.4 percent claimed to spend between 12 and 20 hours a week gaming. Gender split Gaming has traditionally been seen as a more male hobby, and this is reflected in the fact that, on average, men spent more time both during the week and on weekends playing games on the computer. However, the rise of female gamers has been rapid in recent years, with a 2019 figure estimating that 46 percent of all computer and video gamers in the United States are female. This is a significant increase from the 38 percent female gaming population in 2006. Playing games at a professional level can also be a lucrative career for those at the very top of their game. The leading eSports players worldwide have earnings going well into the millions. 
 Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 23 percent of all deaths. Other leading causes of death include cancer, accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases. The leading causes of death worldwide are like those in the U.S. However, lung cancer, road injury, diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are all major causes of death worldwide, but are not among the leading causes in the U.S. Instead, accidents, influenza and pneumonia, intentional self-harm and kidney diseases have a larger impact in the U.S. Racial differences In the United States, there exist slight differences in leading causes of death depending on race and ethnicity. For example, assault, or homicide, accounts for around 3 percent of all deaths among the black population but is not even among the leading causes of death for other races and ethnicities. However, heart disease and cancer are still the leading causes of death for all races and ethnicities. Gender differences Similarly, there are also differences in the leading causes of death in the U.S. depending on gender. For example, among males, intentional self-harm accounts for around 2.5 percent of all deaths but is not among the leading causes of death among females. On the other hand, septicemia and influenza and pneumonia account for more deaths among women than men. 
 This statistic displays a ranking of the top ten Swedish influencers on Instagram ranked by the number of followers. As of August 2017, Anna Nyström (annanystrom) ranked first with 4.9 million followers and Thisis MansWorld (thisisamans.world) came in second with 2.1 million followers. 
 In 2018, Instagram generated an estimated 6.84 billion U.S. dollars in revenue. The photo sharing app’s revenue is projected to more than double to 14 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. Instagram as Facebook revenue driver Initially released in 2010 and quickly acquired by Facebook in 2012 for one billion U.S. dollars, Instagram has been in the public eye since its early days. Instagram’s monthly active users grew from a mere 90 million in January 2013 to over one billion MAU in September 2018 and the platform not showing any signs of slowing down. Apart from strong user growth, Instagram is also one of the most popular social media platforms used by marketers worldwide, second only to Facebook. The mutually beneficial relationship between the social networks has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues, with experts projecting Instagram to generate more than 6.8 billion U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2020. Industry analysts estimate that Instagram will grow to approximately 30 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue up until the end of 2020, with the majority of Facebook’s new revenue being generated through the photo-sharing platform. Despite the rapid growth of Instagram under Facebook’s ownership and cross-platform promotion, not everything has been smooth sailing under the blue flag. In September 2018, founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced their resignation amidst reports of culture and product clashes between Instagram and its parent company. Facebook was quick to appoint a new CEO, and under former Facebook News Feed product manager Adam Mosseri the social network has been trying to make the most of Instagram’s ad potential. In late June 2019, Instagram stated that it will launch ads in its Explore section. The platform already allows ads in the regular feed and Stories.

 In the United States, the average retail price per pound of granulated sugar was roughly 65 U.S. cents in 2017. The price of sugar has fluctuated considerably over the past seventeen years, peaking at almost 70 U.S. cents per pound in 2012. Sugar production Within the 2018/2019 period, a total of just under 180 million metric tons of sugar was produced worldwide. This was a decrease of roughly 15 and a half million tons compared to the previous time span. Over one-sixth of the global 180 million tons was produced by India, the world’s leading producer of sugar during 2018/2019. Other major producers of sugar included Brazil, the EU, and Thailand for that period. Sugar intake Within the same marketing period, an estimated 174 million metric tons’ worth of sugar was consumed by people worldwide. Global sugar consumption has been increasing steadily with each consecutive year since 2009/2010. Some of the world’s leading sugar consumers included many of the same top producing countries and regions, namely India, the EU, and China. India’s sugar consumption amounted to some 27 and a half million metric tons during the 2018/2019 period. 
 This statistic presents information on the projected mobile app store revenues from 2015 to 2020. In 2015, global mobile app revenues amounted to 69.7 billion U.S. dollars. In 2020, mobile apps are projected to generate 188.9 billion U.S. dollars in revenues via app stores and in-app advertising. As of March 2017, there were some 2.8 million apps available in Google Play, the world’s largest app store, while the Apple Store, the second ranked, boasted some 2.2 million available apps in January 2017. As mobile apps become more popular and mobile internet more widely available, revenues generated from applications are reaching unprecedented records. There are a number of different ways in which to generate revenues from apps, including simply charging users a small amount of money per download, but this is not the most popular monetization models among worldwide mobile developers, which claim to use it in some 20 percent of the cases. In fact, statistics show that the number of apps in Google’s Play Store that charge for download has decreased 2015 compared to previous years. A variant of this model is the upgrade, where a free application will offer users the possibility to upgrade to a more enhanced or ad-free version of their product in exchange of a fee. The most widely used revenue stream is advertising, but, according to developers, also the most hated . In-app advertising revenues are set to reach 117.2 million U.S. dollars in 2020, up from 40.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2015.

 The statistic illustrates the revenue development of Amazon Web Services cloud computing and hosting solutions 2013 to 2019. In the last reported year, AWS generated revenues of 35.03 billion U.S. dollars. Amazon Web Services - additional information Amazon.com went online in 1995, initially as a book store, and went on to achieve almost immediate success. In 1998 the store expanded to include a music and video store and different other products, such as apparel and consumer electronics in the following years. The company is the undisputed leader of the e-retail market in the United States, ranking ahead of walmart.com and apple.com in terms of revenue. In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched as a cloud computing platform to provide online services. Among these, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon S3, which provide large virtual computing capacity, are the most well-known. The majority of AWS servers, including the so-called "GovCloud," specifically destined for U.S. government customers, are based in the United States. The company also has locations in Ireland and Germany, Singapore, Japan, China, Australia and Brazil. An estimated 1.4 million servers were operated by Amazon Web Services globally. One of the largest clients of AWS is the streaming video service Netflix, which uses Amazon’s services to store their content on servers throughout the world. Among vendors who supply this so-called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Amazon's IaaS market share stood at 27.2 percent, as of the first half of 2015. As of the third quarter of 2018, AWS reported revenues of over 6.67 billion U.S. dollars, a 45 percent increase compared to first quarter figures of the previous year. Total revenue of Amazon.com during the same period amounted to 56.58 billion U.S. dollars. 
 This statistic shows the development of the gross domestic product of the United States of America from 1990 to 2019. Gross domestic product (GDP) refers to the market value of all goods and services produced within a country. The U.S. GDP increased to about 21.4 trillion U.S. dollars in 2019. The annual growth rate of the Real GDP can be found here. Currently, the United States is ranked first in the world GDP ranking. See, for example, the Russian GDP for comparison. U.S. Finances The gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most important indicators used to analyze the health of an economy. GDP is defined by the BEA as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States, regardless of nationality. It is the primary measure of U.S. production. The OECD defines GDP as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident, institutional units engaged in production (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs). Although the United States had the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the world in 2019, the national debts of the United States are rising steadily. The national debt of the United States amounted to 18.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2014 and grew up to 21.5 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018. A ranking of individual state debt in the United States shows that California is the state with the highest amount of debt in the United States, while New York was on rank 2, New York’s debt amounted to 387.47 billion U.S. dollars. Vermont, North Dakota and South Dakota are the states with the lowest amount of debt. The U.S. government receives a part of its budget from taxpayers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the American government’s tax revenue was about 1.03 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018. Since 2002, the total amounts of the receipts are lower than the amount of the outlays of the United States and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget forecast that the gap between the receipts and outlays of the United States will only continue to widen. The result of this development is that the U.S. won't be able to reduce the national debt within the coming decade. 
 This statistic shows the total number of employed persons in Canada in 2019, distinguished by average usual weekly working hours. In 2019, about 7.28 million Canadians usually worked 40 hours per week. 
 This time series shows the year-on-year revenue growth rate in the semiconductor industry from 1988 to 2018, and forecasted growth rates to 2020. In 2020, the semiconductor industry is predicted to grow by 5.9 percent compared to the previous year. Semiconductors are crucial components of electronics devices. Due to their ability to conduct electricity under some circumstances but not others, they are useful for controlling electrical currents. By adding impurities to a semiconductor, manufacturers are able to customize its conductivity, such as by making it light- or heat-sensitive. 
 In 2018, Germany was the European country with the highest number of skiing participants, with 14.6 million Germans taking part in the sport. When considering the total population, the share of people who ski in European countries was the highest in Liechtenstein and Austria as of 2019, with 36 percent of the population in either country, which comes to a much higher number in Austria due to population size. The UK: A tradition of snowsport Established in 1903 and with over 28,000 members on the books, The Ski Club is the largest and oldest snowsports membership organisation in the UK. The turnover of the organization has grown in the past several years, reaching nearly six million British pounds in 2018. In the same year, it registered gross profit of approximately 1.1 million British pounds. Off piste Freshtracks holidays were most popular among skiers. In 2018, a total of 1,365 skiers chose off piste Freshtrack holidays from Ski Club Great Britain. Weekend ski holidays were chosen by 267 skiers members of the organization. Out of all the different skiing activities, snowboarding is also done by 21 percent of skiers in the United Kingdom (UK). 
 The global revenue of LG Electronics amounted to around 55.76 billion U.S. dollars in 2018.

LG also had a six-percent share of sales volume in the global major household appliances market in 2017, ahead of Samsung and Whirlpool. 
 The statistic shows the index of the persecution of Christians in countries around the world in 2019. North Korea was the country with the strongest suppression of Christians with an index value of 94. The index ranges from 0 (complete freedom) to 100 (total suppression). The survey for the World Watch List included various aspects of religious freedom: the legal and official status of Christians, the actual situation of Christians living in the country, regulations from the state as well as factors that can undermine the freedom of religion in a country. Religion According to a 2010 Pew study on the share of the Christian population in selected countries, 79.5 percent of the U.S. Americans were of Christian confession, making Christianity the most popular religion in the United States. The religious affiliation of the population in the United States in 2017 shows that 38 percent of the U.S. population aged 18-29 were unaffiliated with any religious belief, while only 12 percent of the population aged 65 and older stated they are unaffiliated with any religious belief. For 77 percent of the respondents in the United States, religion is very important or somewhat important, due to the Pew data in 2011. The importance of religion in Germany was lower than in the United States, 52 percent of the participants in Germany stated that religion is not too important or not at all important. India is characterized as a country with a large diversity in religious belief. It is the birthplace of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. The statistic, which was conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2011, shows that 79.8 percent of the total Indian population were Hindu. Muslims made 14.2 percent of the total population and only 2.3 percent were Christian. Americas view on religious diversity, such as in India, was surveyed by Vanity Fair and CBS in 2011. 49 percent of the Evangelical Americans stated that the world would be a better place if everyone was Christian, while 13 percent of the Evangelical Americans said that the world would be a better place with one global religion. 
 This statistic shows the employment rate in the United States. Employed persons consist of: persons who did any work for pay or profit during the survey reference week; persons who did at least 15 hours of unpaid work in a family-operated enterprise; and persons who were temporarily absent from their regular jobs because of illness, vacation, bad weather, industrial dispute, or various personal reasons. The employment-population ratio represents the proportion of the civilian non-institutional population that is employed. In 2019, the U.S. employment rate stood at 60.8 percent. 
 The statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Brazil from 1984 to 2016, with projections up until 2024. GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year. It is considered to be a very important indicator of the economic strength of a country and a positive change is an indicator of economic growth. In 2018, the estimated GDP per capita in Brazil amounted to around 8,958.58 U.S. dollars. For further information see GDP of Brazil. Economical future of Brazil GDP per capita is worked out by taking the country’s total gross domestic product and dividing it by the total population, which essentially helps determine growth of an economy as well as changes in productivity for every person living in the country. As a member of economic organizations such as the G20 as well as the BRIC countries, Brazil has certainly made its mark as one of the strongest economies in the world. Despite experiencing economic fluctuations often, the general direction of the Brazilian economy is mainly positive. With recent improvements within the government, bank and education systems, Brazil has become a slightly more significant option for international investments. Additionally, a profusion of natural resources, a strong agricultural and industrial sector, and a growing service sector has made investors more intrigued in the future of the country. Additionally, at the end of 2014, consumer confidence saw a slight, however noticeable improvement, implying that individual financial situations and hope for the future of the country are very present within the country. Shortly after, consumer confidence plummeted, showing little faith in Brazil's economic future. However, the economic benchmarks point in a different direction. 
 This graphic shows a distribution of Sony's sales and operating revenue in the company's 2018 fiscal year, broken down by business segment. In that year 5.7 percent of the company's sales were through the mobile communications segment. Sony sales by segment - additional information Sony announced total revenue of 75.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2014, the highest the figure has been since 2008. Of this revenue in 2014, over 21 percent, equivalent to 15.83 billion U.S. dollars, was generated in mobile products and communications. This segment is controlled by Sony Mobile Communications which now focuses exclusively on the smartphone market under the Xperia name. As of the final quarter of 2013, Sony Mobile Communications held a 2.1 percent share of sales in the global mobile phone market, which amounted to the sale of 10.38 million mobile phones to end users worldwide. Other lucrative markets for Sony were the Home Entertainment & Sound and the Game sector, which were responsible for 15.3 percent and 12.82 percent respectively of the Japanese company’s total sales in 2014. These two segments generated combined revenue of over 20 billion U.S. dollars. One of the key subsidiaries in this area is Sony Consumer Entertainment, which handles the development, production, and sales of both hardware and software for the PlayStation line of home and handheld video game consoles. In 2014, Sony sold a total of 17 million units of consumer entertainment systems (PS2, PS3, and PS4) worldwide, as well as 3.5 million units of portable entertainment systems (PS Vita and PSP). Despite its market share falling by more than half to 6.3 percent since 2008, Sony also remains the fourth largest vendor of LCD TVs worldwide. The sale of Sony LCD TVs stayed constant at the beginning of 2014, with 3.6 million units sold worldwide in each of the first two quarters. However, sales of the company’s digital cameras have decreased steadily from 4.1 million units in the second quarter of 2012 to 2.2 million units two years later. 
 The number of people over the age of six participating in tackle football in the United States amounted to approximately 5.16 million in 2018. Tackle football vs flag football Football is a popular recreational sport in the United States - for adults, adolescents and children alike. Played with almost the same rules as professional football, children can start playing tackle football around the age of five. Over the past few years, there has been a decline in the number of people participating in tackle football. Comparatively, more and more people have been turning to flag football, where rather than tackling players to the ground (as done in tackle football) the defensive team must remove a flag from the player carrying the ball. In 2018, the number of participants in flag football was approximately 6.57 million, a number that has risen steadily over the past five years. Too old for outdoor activities? It would seem that children participate more often in outdoor activities than people of older age groups do. A survey found that 61 percent of the respondents aged six to 12 participated at least once in an outdoor activity in 2017. Meanwhile, respondents aged 45 and older amounted to less than 40 percent. 
 In 2016, there were about 215,000 serious violent crimes committed by youths between the ages of 12 and 17 in the United States. While the figures for 2017 do not include data for homicides, this is still a significant decrease from 1993 levels, when violent crimes committed by youths hit a peak at over 1.1 million serious crimes. Youth and crime According to the most recent data, most criminal youths in the United States were arrested on robbery and aggravated assault charges. The number of adolescent violent crime victims in the U.S. far surpasses the number of adolescent perpetrators. The number of adolescent victims has also declined significantly since the early 1990s, following the national downward trend of violent crime. Overall downward trends There is not only a downward trend in the number of violent crimes committed by youths, but also in the share of crimes involving youths. On a national level, the crime rate has also decreased in almost every state, showing that the country is becoming safer as a whole. 
 During the 2019-2020 season of the French top professional football league, Ligue 1, Paris-Saint-Germain (PSG) was the football club with the highest average annual player salary. A football player of PSG earned close to nine million euros on average per year. For comparison, this is more than eight times what a player at OGC Nice makes. The football club based in Paris, which should be crowned champion for this season, shows once again its supremacy upon its Ligue 1 competitors. The wage gap of French football The numbers provided in this ranking indicate that Olympique Lyonnais (OL) and Olympique de Marseille (OM), two of the biggest clubs in France, do not offer to their players half of PSG’s average annual salary. The gap between PSG and the other French clubs is even more obvious when looking at the average salary of players of Nîmes or Amiens who do not earn more than 500,000 U.S dollars per year. PSG, one of the richest club in Europe For the 2019/20 Ligue 1 season, the five highest-paid football players in the championship were all PSG players. Brazilian forward Neymar had the highest gross salary of the French Ligue 1. Since the State of Qatar took over the club in 2011, PSG became the richest club in France and one of the wealthiest in Europe. The average annual first-team PSG player salary had increased since 2014 and Kylian Mbappé and Neymar, both transferred to PSG in 2017, became two of the players with the highest estimated transfer value worldwide. 
 Some 17 million motor vehicles were produced in North America in 2018. Vehicle production is a crucial element of the North American economy. Like many other manufacturing segments in the region, vehicle production has slumped in the past two years due to increased costs of production and changes in supply chains, though. Future of free trade and vehicle production In 2016, manufacturers in the NAFTA region produced the most vehicles in one year since the free-trade agreement was signed in 1994, with over 18 million units produced. Although the current free trade agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico has had many opponents, NAFTA has allowed a less restricted flow of products and capital across North America, which is now essential to the automotive industry supply chain. The United States has by far the biggest market share: 11.3 million vehicles were assembled in the United States in 2018, whereas Mexico and Canada only assembled around six million between them. However, it is expected that, In 2020, new rules will govern how the vehicles are produced in the NAFTA region, which of course will have an effect on the consumer. The requirements of the new “United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement”, signed October 2018, will include that rules of origin (ROO) are to be met on automobiles, specifically that 75 percent of the finished vehicles’ value is to come from within the NAFTA governed region: an increase in 12.5 percent. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers was the second leading accounting firm with the greatest number of partners as of March 2019, having 3,500 partners employed in the United States. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) PwC is the second largest professional service firm among the Big Four auditors, and the fifth largest private owned company in the United States. Headquartered in London, they operate in over 158 countries and employed over 250,900 people worldwide.

Accounting services in the U.S. The accounting industry in the United States generated 156 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2018. In that same year, there were about 1.26 million accountants and auditors employed. California had the highest employment level in accounting and auditing in the country as of May 2018. However, accountants and auditors in Washington, D.C. had the highest wages, earning on average 98,130 U.S. dollars yearly. Following Washington, D.C., accountants and auditors working in New York earned on average 96,300 U.S. dollars yearly. 
 The degree of urbanization in the United Kingdom amounted to 83.4 percent in 2018. This shows almost a three percentage point increase over the past decade. The upward trend, though slow, has been consistently positive. What is urbanization? The rate of urbanization indicates the shift away from rural living as people come together in densely populated cities. The United Kingdom is much more urban than the worldwide average. This puts people in closer proximity to jobs, health care, stores, and social opportunities, leading to better economic, health, and social outcomes. For example, areas with higher urbanization have a higher average life expectancy at birth. The darker side of urbanization London is the United Kingdom’s largest city and arguably the financial capital of Europe. However, this economic success has led to increasingly high rental prices, which is an indication of the high cost of living in the city. The higher population density can also lead in an increase in crime. London has one of the highest homicide rates in England and Wales. In spite of these drawbacks, London continues to draw millions of overseas tourists every year. 
 This statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Russia from 1994 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. In 2018, the GDP per capita in Russia was around 11,289.44 U.S. dollars. See the Russian GDP for comparison. Russia's wealth Russia generates most of its wealth through its energy sector, given that a large percentage of its industrial and agricultural sectors have been privatized in the 1990s. The majority of Russia’s exports consisted of natural resources, such as oil, gas and metals. Russia’s primary export partners are located within Europe, with the exception of China, and are often the recipients of a large amount of Russia’s natural gas exports. The country’s second most important and influential sector is the military sector, due to having built up a complex arms industry and having the proficiency to produce high tech weapons. Russia ranks as one of the highest spenders for military production and is one of the more intimidating military powers in the world. Due to the privatization of Russia’s industrial and agricultural sectors, a rather large part of the population was able to capitalize on the market. Russia is home to one of the highest numbers of billionaires in the world, trailing only countries such as the United States and China. 
 The statistic presents the market capitalization of Bitcoin from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2019. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of Bitcoins in circulation by the Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin market capitalization increased from approximately 1.02 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter of 2013 to peak at 238 billion U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2017. It currently sits at 169.44 billion U.S. dollars Bitcoin – additional information While its market capitalization grew at an unbelievable rate from 2013 to 2017, the public is only slowly becoming aware of its existence. As many as 25 percent of Americans were still not familiar with bitcoin and as of 2019. While there are over 18 million bitcoins in circulation, there are only 6,674 Bitcoin ATMs around the world. So its physical presence is minimal, and the majority of ATMs are located in the United States. What makes a bitcoin different than traditional currency is that it is decentralized and no single institution or bank controls the bitcoin network. It is also unique because an account is easy to set up and it is completely transparent. The bitcoin price index (the average bitcoin price across leading global exchanges) has also increased significantly since its creation, rising from 367 U.S. dollars in January 2016 to a peak of over 13,000 U.S. dollars at the end of December 2017. 
 The statistic shows GDP in India from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, GDP in India was at around 2.72 trillion US dollars. See figures on India's economic growth here, and the Russian GDP for comparison. Economic liberalization on the Indian subcontinent Of all the factors and empirical data that give an insight into the shape of a national economy, there aren’t as many indicators more telling than GDP. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a year. Real GDP figures serve as an even more reliable tool in estimating in which direction a country’s economy may be heading, as they are adjusted for inflation and reflect real price developments. The decision of the newly independent Indian government to adopt a mixed economy, adopting both elements of both capitalist and socialist systems, resulted in huge inefficiencies borne out of the culture of interventionism that was a direct result of the lacklustre implementation of policy and failings within the system itself. The desire to move towards a Soviet style mass planning system failed to gain much momentum in the Indian case due to a number of hindrances, an unskilled workforce being one of many. When the government of the early 90’s saw the creation of small scale industry in large numbers due to the removal of price controls, the economy started to bounce back, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union - India’s main trading partner - the hampering effects of socialist policy on the economy were exposed and it underwent a large scale liberalization. By the turn of the 21st century, India was rapidly progressing towards a free-market economy. India’s development has continued and it now belongs to the BRIC group of fast developing economic powers. 
 The timeline depicts the FedEx Corporation's revenue from the fiscal year of 2008 to the fiscal year of 2018. In the fiscal year of 2018, the company generated some 69.69 billion U.S. dollars in revenue. FedEx is ranked among the leading logistics companies in the United States. FedEx Corporation FedEx and other private parcel services became more prominent due to a lack of satisfaction with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Tennessee-headquartered FedEx offers both air and ground courier operations including third-party logistics operations, generating over 69 billion U.S. dollars in the 2019 fiscal year. The company’s key competitors include Georgia-based UPS (United Parcel Service of North America, Inc.), YRC Worldwide and Deutsche Post DHL. In 2012, FedEx was the second-largest for-hire carrier and the leading less-than-truckload (LTL) carrier in the United States. As a result of the world’s growing digitization, the industry has gone through several innovation processes, including the use of GPS* and RFID** technology to track vehicles and parcels. While the ubiquity of electronic mailing continues to trouble the USPS, courier services remain the beneficiaries of growing online retail sales: End customers as well as businesses are increasingly buying physical items online, and these items require delivering. Moreover, parcel processing systems that are able to sort through 20,000 packages in one hour have made the industry more efficient. Satellite computer systems have also improved the state of monitoring Internet-connected courier fleet trucks. Notes: * Global Positioning System ** Radio-frequency Identification 
 This statistic shows the number of tornadoes in the United States from 1995 to 2019. In 2019, there were a total 1,520 tornadoes reported in the United States. 
 From 1990 to 2016, China was the country with highest amount of earthquakes. Between that time period, they reported 157 earthquakes. Indonesia, Iran, Turkey, and Japan rounded out the top five countries with the most earthquakes. What causes earthquakes? When two tectonic plates, which make up the Earth’s crust, shift, it forces shock waves to shake the Earth’s surface, resulting in an earthquake. Earthquakes are measured are on the Richter scale, assessed on a scale of one to nine and higher. The earthquake in Chile in 1960 was the strongest earthquake worldwide, according to the Richter scale, with a magnitude of 9.5. Because earthquakes are not able to be predicted, they can cause more damage than other natural disasters which can be predicted. Earthquake effects Earthquakes have caused a lot of physical damage and casualties. 2004 saw the highest global death toll due to earthquakes, with 298,101 casualties. As a result of this scale of damage, a lot of money goes into repair. For example, the January 17, 1994 California earthquake was the most expensive earthquake to the insurance industry in the United States. Not only did China have the highest number of earthquakes, it was also the country with the most natural disasters in 2018. 
 It is projected that the residential electricity price in the United States will increase by 3.6 percent between 2018 and 2019. Generally, retail electricity prices in the country have risen over the last decade. This trend is likely to continue as natural gas prices will likely also increase, raising electricity rates. As the natural gas supply is exposed to international markets that pay a higher rate, U.S. prices are also expected to rise despite a decrease in recent years that came as a result of the hydraulic fracturing boom. States with the highest and lowest electricity prices The price of electricity is partially dependent on the various energy sources, such as coal, gas, oil, as well as renewable or nuclear sources, used to generate power. Hawaii has one of the highest electricity prices at 32.46 U.S. dollars per kilowatt hour due to the high costs of crude oil used to fuel the state’s electricity. In comparison, Idaho has one of the lowest retail rates, as much of the state’s energy is generated from hydroelectricity which requires virtually no fuel and construction costs can be spread out over decades. Bills can vary greatly depending on both state and region. Demand for electricity is also expected to increase, especially in regions that will likely require more heating and cooling as climate change impacts progress, driving up electricity prices.

 In 2019, the estimated youth unemployment rate in India was at 10.51 percent. According to the source, the data are ILO estimates. For the past decade, India’s youth unemployment rate has been hovering around the 10 percent mark. What is the youth unemployment rate? The youth unemployment rate refers to those in the workforce who are aged 15 to 24 years and without a job, but actively seeking one. Generally, youth unemployment rates are higher than the adult unemployment rates, and India is no exception: youth unemployment in India is significantly higher than the national unemployment rate. The Indian workforce, young and old India’s unemployment rate in general is not remarkably high when compared to those of other countries. Both India’s unemployment rate and youth unemployment rate are below their global equivalents. In a comparison of the Asia-Pacific region countries, India ranks somewhere in the middle, with Cambodia’s unemployment rate being estimated to be below one percent, and Afghanistan’s the highest at 8.8 percent.

In the last measured year fiscal period, the multinational e-commerce company's net revenue was 136 billion U.S. dollars, up from 107 billion U.S. dollars in 2015. Amazon.com, an American electronic commerce company originally founded in 1994, is the world’s largest online retailer of books, clothing, electronics, music and many more goods. As of 2016, the company generates the majority of it's net revenues through online retail product sales, followed by third-party retail seller services, retail subscription services including Amazon Prime, and AWS. Amazon is also the producer of the leading e-book reader, the Amazon Kindle. Through Amazon, consumers are able to purchase goods at a rather discounted price from both small and large companies as well as from other users. Both new and used goods are sold on the website. Due to the wide variety of goods available at prices which often undercut local brick-and-mortar retail offerings, Amazon has dominated the retailer market. As of 2016, Amazon’s brand worth amounts to approximately almost 100 billion U.S. dollars, topping the likes of companies such as Walmart, Ikea, as well as digital competitors Alibaba and eBay. One of Amazon's first forays into the world of hardware was its e-reader Kindle, one of the most popular e-book readers worldwide. In recently years, Amazon has also released smartphone, tablets and multimedia sticks under it's Fire brand in order to increase digital media consumption via these devices. This strategy is connected to the digital Amazon ecosystem which features video and audio content as value-added services for Prime subscribers. Due to its location, Amazon offers more services in North America than worldwide. As a result, the majority of the company’s net revenue in 2016 was actually earned in the United States and Canada. In 2016, approximately 79.79 billion U.S. dollars was earned in North America compared to only roughly 43.98 billion U.S. dollars internationally. 
 This statistic shows the number of available applications in the Google Play Store from December 2009 to December 2019. The number of available apps in the Google Play Store was most recently placed at 2.9 million apps, after surpassing 1 million apps in July 2013. Google Play was originally launched in October 2008 under the name Android Market. As Google’s official app store it offers its customers a range applications and digital media including music, magazines, books, film and TV. With the majority share of apps available from the Google Play Store being free of charge, the company needs to utilize effective business models to secure healthy revenue. As of March 2019, the top grossing Android apps worldwide included popular gaming apps such as Pokemon Go and the ever-popular Candy Crush Saga. Despite the robust gaming app revenues, the majority of gaming apps are free to download and rely on monetization via in-game purchases of items such as boosters and accessories. 
 By 2030, the number of military retirees in the United States is expected to reach 2.21 million; an increase from an estimated 2.18 million retirees in 2020. Military retirement pay Military retirement pay was created to acknowledge those who served their country through a military career. Those who served in active duty, reserves, or guard for at least 20 years are entitled to military retirement pay. There are different factors that influence how much is paid out to different veterans, which includes length of service, disability percentage, the year the person entered the military, and type of retirement. The total payment for military retirees is expected to continue to increase, as well as their average benefits. However, the total outlays for the military retirement trust fund is expected to fluctuate over the next couple years. U.S veterans The United States has one of the largest militaries in the world based on active personnel and has the largest defense budget in the world. However, many veterans in the U.S. struggle to find a job and find affordable housing when they return from deployment due to factors such as post-traumatic stress disorder and physical disabilities. The Department of Veteran Affairs seeks to help those coming back from training or combat assimilate back into everyday life. 
 More than half of the world’s population identify as feminists - in India alone, over 80 percent of respondents very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists. Surprisingly, this number is much lower in developed countries like the United States or Germany (with not even 40 percent of respondents agreeing), which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully – has. But are some really more equal than others? Despite its deceptive title, feminism is not about establishing superiority of women – its core concept is equality for all, no matter their sex, gender, or orientation. Achieving this equality means championing women with more force and verve than has been done before, since today’s societies are deeply patriarchal – i.e. they favor men over women. Critics often misinterpret this support of women as an attempt to suppress and attack men – when in fact, feminism and equality for all benefits them as well. The country of the poets and thinkers seems stuck In Germany, feminism is on the rise, but traditional gender roles and insufficient information still hinder progress. Only a third of German women, and even fewer German men, define themselves as feminist, while at the same time, over 70 percent of women and almost 60 percent of men would agree that gender equality is important to them. Still, they are not convinced that discrimination against women is ending anytime soon. Most of all, they say, reallocating responsibility and adjusting payrolls would help to achieve a feminist society. 
 The statistic shows the unemployment rate in Japan from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate in Japan was at about 2.41 percent. Employment and the economy in Japan Japan is one of the leading countries when it comes to economic key factors; its unemployment rate, for example, is lower than that of other major industrial and emerging countries. The Japanese work ethic is well-known worldwide, it is synonymous with a strong devotion to the company and to the task at hand; competition among co-workers and loyalty to the company are common and encouraged, working hours and over-time work are said to be excessive. The Japanese language even has its own term for sudden death from being overworked – “Karoshi”. After the devastating effects of World War II, Japan managed to recover economically and even earn a prominent role among other leading economic powers – a fact which is probably partly due to this attitude towards work and employment. Today, Japan is among the leading import countries worldwide, as well as the leading export countries worldwide. Additionally, Japan is one of the 20 countries with the largest proportion of the global domestic product, and also among the 20 countries with the largest gross domestic product per capita, even though it is also ranked tenth among the leading countries with the largest population. 
 It is expected that by 2023, around 62.5 million Filipinos will become users of a social network. Considering the forecasted population of around 118 million, it reflects the high popularity of social media in the Philippines. Current state of social media in the Philippines The Philippines have been called the social media capital of the world, because most of the social media users have an extraordinarily high usage time of about four hours per day. Additionally, they are known as early technology adopters, as well as being highly internet-savvy. Yet the infrastructure cannot keep up with the population’s needs. The archipelago consists of around seven thousand islands, making it difficult for the government to provide basic connectivity. As of 2017, around 64 million out of 105 million inhabitants had internet access. While 81 percent of the 18- to 24-year-olds were already online, only twelve percent of those aged 55 years and older were able to access the internet . How are the Philippines able to improve their accessibility? Since it is widely recognized that internet access has an impact on economic growth, local authorities must focus on further expanding the network. There are few promising technologies to do so: fiber cables could be installed and even reduce the cost of telecommunication companies in the end. The upcoming 5G network could help connect remote areas with a trustworthy connection, and if that is too far into the future, satellites could be a viable choice for now; they are able to reach every point on the earth, making them key for achieving nationwide connectivity. 
 Singapore posted a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 3.7 percent in 2017, after adjusting for inflation. While up from the previous two years, this number is expected to decline in 2018, settling around 3.14 percent. What is GDP? GDP is a measure of a country’s income, and most economists agree that slow but steady GDP growth is best for a developed economy. GDP measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country during a certain time period. With the highest GDP per capita in ASEAN, Singapore certainly qualifies as developed, meaning that it should target GDP growth around 2 to 3 percent. Singapore’s context Singapore is a small, open economy. As such, it has little influence on, and high exposure to, international trends. For example, a shift in the exchange rate with a major trading partner can have significant effects on the economy. For Singapore, who relies heavily on exports, these kinds of shocks can affect the entire economy. For example, a weaker Singapore dollar would increase GDP by raising net exports, but this would also lead to higher inflation. As a result, policymakers in Singapore have to follow many factors if they want to continue enjoying healthy GDP growth. 
 As of January 2020, the price of rubber amounted to 1.68 U.S. dollars per kilogram. The average annual price of natural rubber at the Singapore Commodity Exchange (one of the key global commodity exchanges for rubber) reached a high of 4.82 U.S. dollars per kilogram in 2011. Since then, the price decreased to an annual average of 1.64 U.S. dollars per kilogram in 2019. Rubber prices and rubber producers Rubber is a widely used material, in both naturally and synthetically sourced forms. Companies use it in the manufacturing of tires and tubes, rubber gloves, latex condoms, erasers, in adhesives and coatings, nozzles, as elastic material in clothing, and more. Accordingly, rubber is an important commodity due to its numerous uses in everyday items. Rubber prices and rubber producers As with other internationally traded commodities that have relatively low market prices, low rubber prices have a negative impact on the rubber producers themselves. The resulting issues of poverty for natural rubber producers has led to the creation of the Fair Rubber Association (FRA), which is a multi-stakeholder association that aims to improve the lives and working conditions of the primary producers by utilizing Fair Trade principles. 
 This statistic shows the number of hours spent cooking per week among consumers worldwide as of June 2014, by country. Respondents from India spent the most time cooking at an average of 13.2 hours per week. Cooking - additional information In the broadest sense, cooking is the process of preparing food for consumption, generally using heat. The act of cooking varies massively all over the world, from the ingredients available to the techniques used. Many people cook at an amateur level while some cook to earn a living. For most, cooking might just be a necessary part of survival, whereas others cook for enjoyment – globally 37 percent of women and 27 percent of men say that they are passionate about food and cooking. During a survey of 27,000 people from 22 countries worldwide in summer 2014, market research company GfK found that people in India spent the most time cooking per week. Indian cuisine is very diverse, reflecting the vast array of ingredients, cultures and religions that determine the meals people eat in the country’s many regions. Outside of India, Indian “curry” has become hugely popular in western countries such as the UK and the U.S. While Indian cooking has often been adapted to suit western tastes in these countries, recent restaurant trends show that there is a demand for authentic ethnic cuisine. With the number of tourists traveling both in and out of India increasing, the popularity of Indian cuisine may be set to spread further around the world. Whether people cook for their hobby or simply out of necessity, many prefer to dine out and not cook at all. In the United States, people spend less than half the time cooking per week than those in India and in 2016 around 34 percent of U.S. consumers dined at a quick service restaurant, at at least once per week. 
 The statistic represents the passenger load factor (PLF) of international flights in December 2019, by region. In that month, the international passenger load factor in Europe stood at 83.5 percent. Passenger load factor When it comes to international passenger boardings, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York (JFK) is the busiest airport in the United States, its most in-demand transatlantic route being the passage to London Heathrow (LHR). Aircraft that are used on flight routes with a very high passenger demand require a high seating capacity to transport as many passengers as possible on board. The full utilization of an aircraft’s seating capacity is an effective measurement for airlines to increase revenue. To give an example, the largest Dreamliner variant seats up to 330 passengers, and the flight distance from John F. Kennedy airport to London Heathrow comes to around 3,450 miles. The passenger load factor is the quotient of the number of seat miles and passenger miles traveled. While seat miles are calculated by multiplying the number of seats on board with the number of miles travelled, passenger miles are the product of the amount of miles traveled and the number of passengers carried. A fully-seated Dreamliner traveling from JFK to LHR carries the same number of seat and passenger miles and thus has a passenger load factor of one. In other words, its seating capacity is fully utilized. 
 In 2018, there were about 54.7 million internet users in Vietnam. By 2023, it was forecasted to be 75.7 million. The number of users rapidly increased after the adoption of the internet in Vietnam in 1997. In 2018, the internet penetration rate reached 57 percent . Still, internet take-up in Vietnam has been much slower than its neighboring countries. Internet usage habits On average, Vietnamese spent about 7 hours per day on the internet. Vietnamese internet users mostly used mobile phones to access the internet in 2018. Mobile internet users spent the most time on watching videos and using mobile messengers. With regards to social media, Facebook and YouTube are the most popular networks in Vietnam. The importance of internet for online business The internet economy in Vietnam was valued at nine billion U.S. dollars in 2018, contributing four percent to the country’s GDP. The increasing internet usage and penetration via both desktop and smartphones have several implications for the Vietnamese internet economy. E-commerce in Vietnam was forecasted to double its market value in 2020. Mobile shopping is becoming especially popular. Digital payments, online gaming, music and video streaming, as well as online ride- hailing and online travel services, are also increasing in popularity and market value. 
 The statistic depicts the tennis players with the most Grand Slam tournament titles. Roger Federer has won the most Grand Slam titles, most recently the Australian Open in 2018, with a total of 20. He has also consistently ranked amongst the top tennis players in the ATP Rankings throughout his career. Most Grand Slam wins - additional information The Grand Slam tournaments, also known as the majors, are the four most important annual tennis tournaments. The Australian Open (played on hard court) is the first major of the year, taking place in mid-January, followed by French Open (played on clay) in May/June. Wimbledon, the only of the four majors to be played on grass, takes place in June/July, and the Grand Slam seasons finishes with the US Open (hard court) played in August/September. Roger Federer has won a record-breaking 20 Grand Slam titles, including five consecutive victories at Wimbledon from 2003 to 2007, matching a feat otherwise only achieved by Björn Borg (1976-80 and 11 total Grand Slam titles) in the Open Era. Federer also won five consecutive titles at the US Open from 2004 to 2008, breaking the previous record of three consecutive titles achieved by Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe. With his victory at Wimbledon in 2009, Federer gained his 15th Grand Slam title and thus broke the record of 14 previously held by Pete Sampras. Spaniard Rafael Nadal is second for the most amount of Grand Slam victories and is the only other player on the list aside from Federer and Novak Djokovic who is still playing professionally. Nadal holds the honor of being the only player to have won five consecutive titles at the French Open (2010 to 2014) following the four consecutive titles he won there from 2005 to 2008. By winning his ninth French Open title in 2014, Nadal became the first male to win nine major titles at a Grand Slam event, which is only equaled by Martina Navratilova’s nine victories at Wimbledon Nadal also holds the record for being the youngest player to win all four majors at the age of 24 and remains the only player to win one Grand Slam or more for 10 consecutive years. 
 The statistic shows the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate in EU member states as of August 2019. The source defines youth unemployment as unemployment of those younger than 25 years. In August 2019, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate in Spain was at 32.2 percent. Youth unemployment rate in EU member states Unemployment is a crucial economic factor for a country; youth unemployment is often examined separately because it tends to be higher than unemployment in older age groups. It comprises the unemployment figures of a country’s labor force aged 15 to 24 years old (i.e. the earliest point at which mandatory school education ends). Typically, teenagers and those in their twenties who are fresh out of education do not find jobs right away, especially if the country’s economy is experiencing difficulties, as can be seen above. Additionally, it also tends to be higher in emerging markets than in industrialized nations. Worldwide, youth unemployment figures have not changed significantly over the last decade, nor are they expected to improve in the next few years. Youth unemployment is most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa, even though these regions report high unemployment figures regardless (Zimbabwe and Turkmenistan are among the countries with the highest unemployment rates in the world, for example), and are also highly populated areas with a rather weak infrastructure, compared to industrialized regions. In the European Union and the euro area, unemployment in general has been on the rise since 2008, which is due to the economic crisis which caused bankruptcy and financial trouble for many employers, and thus led to considerable job loss, less job offerings, and consequently, to a rise of the unemployment rate. Older workers are struggling to find new jobs despite their experience, and young graduates are struggling to find new jobs, because they have none. All in all, the number of unemployed persons worldwide is projected to rise, this is not down to the economic crisis alone, but also the industrial automation of processes previously performed by workers, as well as rising population figures. 
 The graph shows the number of employed people in China from 2008 to 2018. In 2018, the workforce in China had amounted to around 775.9 million people.Workforce in China – additional information In 2017, China’s total population had reached 1.39 billion. The labor force of China, which refers to the population aged 16 and over and capable of working, stood at 806 million in 2018, marking a slight decrease of one million people from 2017. Out of the economically active population, approximately 776 million had been employed in 2018. As of 2018, there were about 43.4 billion people employed in urban areas, while 342 million people had been working in rural areas. Although the workforce in China had been steadily increasing, the labor force participation rate in China, meaning the share of the Chinese working-age population that participated in the labor force had slightly decreased, dropping from 72.3 percent in 2007 to 68.9 percent in 2017. Between 2008 to 2018, the share of the workforce employed in the primary sector had declined significantly in China from 39.6 percent in 2008 to 26.1 percent in 2018, whereas the percentage of people employed in the secondary and tertiary sectors increased. As of 2018, about 27.6 percent of Chinese workers had been employed in secondary and 46.3 percent in tertiary industries.Partly influenced by the implementation of the one-child policy, the fertility rate in China has receded, resulting in a demographic shift of the age pyramid and, in turn, of the overall workforce. 
 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in South Korea from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in South Korea amounted to about 1.48 percent compared to the previous year. For further info, see the South Korean GDP. South Korea's low inflation High rates of inflation are undesireable, just like low rates, and South Korea is currently struggling with the latter. South Korea is actually an affluent country and currently ranks 11th on the list of the 20 countries with the largest GDP, but its inflation rate is subject to concern, as it is currently at levels below 2 percent. However, there is still hope that inflation will return to stable rates between 3 and 4.5 percent in the next few years, and there are also signs that consumer confidence is rising after two years of weak economic growth and sluggish domestic consumption and investment. The unemployment rate remains low with levels staying in the range of 3 percent - close to full employment – yet there are still obstacles including an aging population and a heavy reliance on exports. At present, South Korea is attempting to balance its reliance on exports by expanding the service industry, especially as the export market slows. 
 The statistic shows the countries with the largest number of overseas Chinese. According to the statistic, 700,000 Chinese expatriates had lived in South Korea.Migration in China – additional information Many Chinese people have emigrated from the country in search of better living conditions and educational chances. The increasing number of Chinese emigrants has benefited from loosened migration policies. On one hand, the attitude of the Chinese government towards emigration has changed significantly. Overseas Chinese are considered to be strong supporters for the overall strength of Chinese culture and international influence. On the other hand, migration policies in the United States and Canada are changing with time, expanding migration opportunities for non-European immigrants.In 2013, the United States and Canada had become the countries with the highest immigration rate of millionaires from China according to Hurun Research Institute, accounting for 25 percent and 23 percent of Chinese millionaire emigrants that year, respectively. In 2013 alone, the number of people from China naturalized as U.S. citizens had amounted to over 35,000 people, while nearly 72,000 had obtained legal permanent resident status as “green card” recipients. Among other popular immigration destinations for Chinese riches are Europe, Australia, and Singapore. China has become one of the world’s largest emigration countries as well as the country with the biggest outflows of high net worth individuals between 2003 and 2013. However, the mass emigration is starting to cause a severe loss of homegrown talents and assets. The problem of talent and wealth outflow has raised pressing questions to the Chinese government, and a solution to this issue is yet to be determined. 
 The statistic ranks the tennis players by the prize money won in 2019. Rafael Nadal has won 8.08 million U.S. dollars in prize money in 2019 so far. He has also consistently ranked amongst the top tennis players in the ATP Rankings throughout his career. 
 This statistic shows the unemployment rate of Iran from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, Iran's unemployment rate was estimated to amount to 11.99 percent of the total labor force. Employment and economy in Iran Iran’s unemployment rate has been above 10 percent for the last 10 years, and this rate is estimated to have peaked in 2014, when estimates reached 14 percent. Also, many of those who are considered employed in Iran are also considered underemployed. Unemployment in Iran is especially high among young people and women; over 70 percent of the population’s close to 80 million inhabitants are of working age, increasing the overall demand of these inhabitants for work. Iran’s economy has also been in a recession, which has exacerbated the difficulties to meet the employment demands of its inhabitants. Although the economy is expected to recover slightly in 2014, Iran's GDP is expected to decrease and the real GDP growth rate is either negative or quite low. In times of a struggling economy, it is typically more difficult to create jobs and introduce people to the labor force. Because Iran's economic activity still depends to a large extent on oil revenues, this also reduces the stability of the economy and employment. With a decreasing per capita GDP and a high inflation rate people are also more vulnerable to changes in income and employment, making the unemployment a pressing issue that the country will have to manage. 
 The statistic shows Mexico’s GDP from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, Mexico’s GDP amounted to approximately 1.22 trillion US dollars.Economy of Mexico GDP is an indicator primarily used to gauge the state and health of a national economy. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within national borders in a given period of time, usually a year. GDP gives us an insight into a country’s economic development over a period of time, how its development fits in with international shifts and how it is affected by the factors that affect market economies. The demand among some segments of the Chinese workforce for fairer payment, coupled with higher transportations costs, have been key factors in increasing the competitiveness of Mexican manufacturing, with some suggestions being made that it is already cheaper than China for the many industries that serve the lucrative United States market. The Mexican economy is, however, far from trouble-free. And although the gross domestic product in Mexico has been increasing, it is showing that it is struggling to match up to the fast pace of growth and prosperity being seen in some of the BRIC countries, as well as the usual suspects of economic success, the United States, Canada and others. Inequality in Mexico remains a huge problem. The education system in the federation’s thirty-one states is in dire need of reform, and in some of the states, especially in those closest to the US border, brutal criminal drug lords'rule. It is important for Mexicans that they embrace the opportunity that they find themselves presented with at present and harness the energy of their large population , the newly arrived foreigners and their educated youth, in order to provide the country with the future prosperity that it most desperately needs. 
 The chart shows the distribution of Android apps per download range as of the first quarter 2018. As of the measured period, 21.12 percent of apps in the Google Play Store had generated 100 to 500 downloads. Only 0.1 percent of apps managed to accumulate more than five million downloads. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2019, Twitter’s revenue amounted to over 1 billion U.S. dollars, a 22 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. The majority of the social network’s revenues are generated via advertising, followed by data licensing and other revenues. Twitter company information Twitter ranks among the biggest social networks worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company reported 152 million monetizable daily active users. In 2019, Twitter’s annual revenue came to 3.46 billion U.S. dollars. However, the company only reported positive net income for the first time in 2018, revealing a struggle to monetize users. Twitter marketing and advertising Social media advertising spending in the United States is constantly growing. In 2018, the social media ad spend per U.S. internet user amounted to 96.8 U.S. dollars and this figure is projected to sharply increase to over 232 U.S. dollars by 2023. Along with Instagram, Twitter is a popular marketing channel and some brands and companies have made a name for themselves for being entertaining on Twitter. 
How many people have iPhones in the United States? Currently there are more than 100 million iPhone users in the United States, accounting for about 45 percent of all smartphone users in the United States. Overall, more than 250 million people in the United States use a smartphone, which means that roughly 80 percent of the country’s population has access to a smartphone. Since 2009, Apple has sold more than 1.5 billion iPhones, making it one of the most used smartphones in the world. Apple iPhone worldwide Apple’s iOS operating system has a share of 50 percent of the mobile operating system market in the United States, the country with the highest market share both for the iPhone and the iOS operating system. In no other country Apple has such a dominant market position but still is one of the top three smartphone vendors worldwide, selling more than 200 million iPhones every year. Taken together the top three smartphone vendors Samsung, Huawei, and Apple account for around half of the annual smartphone shipments. iPhone is Apple’s main revenue source The iPhone is the Apple’s main source of revenue, consistently generating more than 50 percent of the company's sales worldwide. Apple does offer a multitude of other products across a variety of consumer electronics categories though, including laptops, smartwatches, and tech-related services such as its app store, Apple Pay and cloud storage. 
 In the past decade, Japan’s degree of urbanization has leveled off at around 91 percent. This means that less than 10 percent of Japan’s population of 126 million inhabitants do not live in an urban setting. Japan is well above the degree of urbanization worldwide, which is 55 percent. Japan is also known for its high population density: In 2017, it amounted to an eye-watering 347.78 inhabitants per square kilometer - however, it is not even among the top twenty countries with the highest population density worldwide. That ranking is lead by Monaco, followed by China, and Singapore. Japan’s aging population The main demographic challenge that Japan currently faces is an aging population, as the number of inhabitants over 65 years old is an increasing percentage of the population. As of 2018, Japan is the country with the largest percentage of total population over 65 years, and life expectancy at birth there is about 84 years. Simultaneously, the birth rate in Japan is declining, resulting in negative population growth in recent years. One method Japan is using to address these demographic shifts is by investing in automated work processes; it's one of the top countries interested in collaborative robots. 
 The share of United Kingdom households that own a home computer reached a plateau of 88 percent, starting in 2015/16. It wasn’t until 2002/03 that home computers could be found in a majority of households in the United Kingdom, when the rate of ownership jumped from 49 percent to 55 percent. Changing face of the home computer Although most households contain a computer, the actual device used is likely to have changed considerably in recent years. In 2010 the majority of households still reported owning a desktop PC or iMac computer, with 52 percent of people owning such a device. By 2018, this rate fell to just 28 percent. Laptops, conversely, have been on the rise, with the penetration rate increasing from 47 percent in 2009, to 63 percent in 2018. Laptop sales According to the most recent figures from the United Kingdom (UK) Office for National Statistics (ONS), the sales value of laptops, notebooks and palm-top organizers reached 58.79 billion British pounds in 2017. In that same year, 46 percent of respondents to a Statista survey reported buying a laptop every 3-5 years. Worldwide, total laptop sales are expected to reach 171 million units in 2023, up from 166 million units in 2019. Desktop sales are expected to contract, from 88.4 million units in 2019, to 79.5 million units by 2023. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2019, Venmo’s net payment volume amounted to 29 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 56 percent year-on-year growth. The company had more than 40 million active accounts at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Venmo usage in the United States Venmo is a U.S.-based digital wallet service owned by PayPal. According to a March 2019 survey of online payment users in the United States, 20 percent of respondents had used Venmo in the past 12 months. Parent company PayPal ranked first with a U.S. audience reach of 89 percent. However, during the same survey, only six percent of respondents stated that they used Venmo to pay for their online purchases, indicating that the service was more popular for peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers than for online shopping payments. Venmo ranks as one of the most popular P2P payment services in the United States, along with Zelle and Square Cash. Venmo was originally created so friends could quickly split bills and the app has a stronger social networking component than other payment apps. When making a transaction, the transaction details (minus the payment amount) are shared on the user's news feed and to the user's network of friends and contacts, similar to a social media feed. Every transaction has a memo line where users involved in the transaction can comment on the nature of the payment – rent, pizza, or movie tickets, and the app suggests emoji instead of words. In 2018, the FTC has demanded that Venmo make it more obvious to consumers that their transactions were largely public and that it should be easier for users to change their privacy settings. The company maintains that the social experience of the public feed is one of the core appeals of the app, but also stated that users were able to change their settings to private. 
 The number of commercial casinos in the United States year-over-year has been relatively consistent, showing a steady increase from 2010 onwards. This changed in 2018 where there was a total of 465 commercial U.S. casinos, showing a decline from the previous year's figure of 560. Popularity of gaming in the U.S. Over half of the leading casino companies worldwide are based in the U.S., therefore it comes as no surprise that gambling is a popular past-time. Casinos make up the largest part of the commercial gaming segment, popular with U.S.-citizens and international tourists alike. In 2017, commercial gaming in the U.S. generated approximately 40 billion U.S. dollars in revenue. Las Vegas Unsurprisingly, Las Vagas had by far for the highest proportion of the commercial gaming revenue in 2017. Comparatively, the second largest U.S. commercial gaming location was Atlantic City, totalling nearly two and a half billion U.S. dollars in commercial gaming revenue. Other leading commercial gaming markets include cities such as Chicago, New York City, and Baltimore. 
 This statistic shows the monthly percentage of change in disposable personal income in the United States from January 2019 to January 2020. Disposable personal income increased by 0.6 percent in January 2020 from the previous month. The data are in current U.S. dollars, seasonally adjusted at annual rates. Disposable personal income in the United States According to the BEA, personal income is the income that is received by persons from all sources. It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, supplements to wages and salaries, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and personal current transfer receipts, less contributions for government social insurance. Disposable personal income is total after-tax income received by persons; it is the income available to persons for spending or saving. Disposable personal income is a significant indicator of an economy’s health. Personal income determines an individual’s ability to consume goods and services, i.e. personal consumption expenditure, and industries producing consumer goods and services contribute heavily to United States gross domestic product. The retail trade industry, for example, contributed 1.1 trillion chained 2012 U.S. dollars to the GDP of the United States in 2018. Total Real GDP amounted to about 18.57 trillion U.S. dollars that year. The arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services industry contributed 692.9 billion U.S. dollars to the GDP in 2018. Personal income in the United States was 17.57 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018, the highest value in over ten years. From July 2016 to July 2017, average daily consumer spending rose from 100 U.S. dollars in July 2016 to 109 U.S. dollars in July 2017. 
 The number of recreational visitors to the Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP) in the U.S. reached a total of 5.97 million in 2019. This shows a drop when compared to previous year's total of 6.38 million visitors. The number of visitors has increased by about 2 million people per year in the last seven years. Discussions and plans within the park and surrounding cities have begun to implement better infrastructure for the increase in tourism with conservation and climate change action plans in mind. Grand Canyon National Park Grand Canyon National Park boasts access to an impressive river canyon that totals 277 miles in length with widths of up to 18 miles. GCNP is among the most visited parks in the United States as of 2018. The park has regions that are open year-round and others that are only accessible in the summer. Most visits to U.S. national parks occur during the summer months with significant declines in the winter months. National Park visitors in the U.S. National parks are a tremendously popular vacation and adventure destination within the U.S. and since the early 2000’s the number of national park visitors in the U.S. has increased significantly. As of 2017, out of all national parks and sites, those with the designation of national park accounted for the largest proportion of all park-related recreational visits in the United States. Despite being wildly popular, most of the visitor spending on national park visits is attributable to hotels, motels and bed and breakfasts, with admission fees being a significantly smaller proportion of the overall spending. 
 In 2018, Costa Rica, Philippines, and Brazil were the top three pineapple producers worldwide. Costa Rica generated 3.42 million metric tons of pineapples in that year. Overall pineapple production in that year amounted to 27.92 million metric tons. Pineapple cultivation Pineapple cultivation is quite time intensive. The fruit needs between 14 to 18 months before it reaches full maturity and is ready to harvest. Pineapples also grow best in tropical areas, which is why the vast majority of pineapples come from countries similar to Costa Rica in climate. Pineapple consumption in the United States Pineapple can be consumed fresh or eaten alongside savory foods such as chicken, ham, or beef. The average American consumed about 7.7 pounds of fresh pineapple in 2017. Canned pineapple is also widely available in the United States, though per capita consumption of canned fruit in general has decreased substantially between 2000 and 2018. 
 In the third quarter of 2019, Pandora had 63.1 million monthly active users in the United States. The online radio platform has been suffering gradual user losses each quarter for some time, and has lost more than ten million U.S. users in the last two years. Pandora - additional information Pandora Internet Radio is a part of the Music Genome Project that provides a music streaming service as well as music recommendations.

Through the Music Genome Project, Pandora does not focus on genres of music, but interprets qualities of melody, harmony, rhythm, form, composition, and lyrics to determine music recommendations for its users. As a unique source of music, Pandora is used by almost a third of consumers monthly and almost a quarter use it weekly. In recent years, as Pandora has become more successful, the company’s revenue has reflected its broadening market. In the financial year 2016, Pandora’s revenue totaled 1.38 billion U.S. dollars, a figure which has risen sharply on an annual basis since the company’s launch. Pandora currently obtains most of its revenue through advertisement, subscriptions, and directing users to purchase music through Apple and Amazon. In 2016, the company's advertising revenue exceeded one billion U.S. dollars for the first time.

 This statistic shows the reported violent crime rate in the U.S. since 1990. In 2018, the nationwide rate was 368.9 cases per 100,000 of the population. Even though the violent crime rate has been decreasing since 1990, the United States top the ranking of countries with the most prisoners. Reported violent crime rate in the United States The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks the rate of reported violent crimes per 100,000 U.S. inhabitants. In the timeline above, rates are shown starting in 1990. The rate of reported violent crime has fallen since a high of 758.20 reported crimes in 1991 to a low of 361.6 reported violent crimes in 2014. In 2018, there were roughly 1.21 million violent crimes committed in the United States. This number can be compared to the total number of property crimes, roughly 7.2 million that year. Of violent crimes in 2018, there were 807,400 aggravated assaults, making this offense the most common of violent crime offenses. Though the violent crime rate was down in 2012, the number of law enforcement officers also fell. Between 2005 and 2009, the number of law enforcement officers in the United States rose from around 673,100 to 708,600. However, since 2009, the number of officers fell to a low of 626,900 officers in 2013. The number of law enforcement officers has since grown, reaching 686,700 in 2018. In 2018, the crime clearance rate was highest for murders and non-negligent manslaughters, with around 62.3 percent of murders being solved by investigators and a suspect being charged with the crime. Roughly 52.5 percent of aggravated assaults were cleared in that year. A dossier of statistics on violent crime in the U.S. can be found here. 
 Manchester United had an average attendance of 74,879 for their home games in the 2018/19 season, their lowest since 2009/10. Despite the fall in numbers, Manchester United had the highest average attendance of all 20 English Premier League clubs in 2018/19. The Theatre of Dreams Manchester United play their homes games at the largest stadium in the English Premier League: Old Trafford. The venue has a capacity of around 76,000 for soccer games, meaning the stadium is around 99 percent full for each home fixture. Manchester United have won an English record 20-top division titles, but were last crowned champions of England in 2012/13 – the club’s longest run without a league title since the English Premier League was formed in 1992/93. The average attendance at Old Trafford fell despite the cheapest matchday ticket for Manchester United being a competitively priced 31 British pounds in the 2018/19 season; the recent performances of the team may be one reason why some supporters were not tempted through the turnstiles. Glory glory Man United In financial terms, the club continues to grow regardless of recent on-field failings. The total revenue of Manchester United increased to around 776 million U.S. dollars in 2018, helped by annual rises in sponsorship revenue. Despite a relatively short league title drought, the club can still attract global partners and sign lucrative contracts because sponsors want to be associated with a brand that was ranked the third most valuable soccer club worldwide in 2019 – only Spanish sides Real Madrid and Barcelona had a greater value. 
 This statistic shows the Number of strong earthquakes in the U.S. from 1974 to 2003, by state. From 1974 to 2003, 12,053 strong earthquakes have been recorded in Arkansas. 
 The graph presents the leading eSports tournaments worldwide as of November 2019, ranked by overall prize pool. As of the measured period, The International 2019, which took place in Shanghai in August 2019 and featured DOTA 2, ranked first, with a total prize pool of 34.33 million U.S. dollars. eSports prize pool – additional information The entire eSports market is expected to grow over the coming years. From an estimated 865 million U.S. dollars in 2018, worldwide revenues are projected to increase to 1.79 billion in 2022. Looking at the latest regional profitability data, Asia was considered to be generating the lion’s share of the revenues in 2017, followed by North America with its 392 million U.S. dollar eSports market. While the International 2017 was the leading tournament of 2017 based on the overall prize pool, the combined prize pools for all eSports events that year reached 121.1 million U.S. dollars worldwide. The fact that only a year earlier the prize pools were reported 25 million less than that amount illustrates the increasing worth and significance of this segment of the gaming industry. What is more, in 2017, it was calculated that DOTA 2, the official game of The International championships, accounted for 34.3 percent of the total eSports prize money that year. That same year, 10.84 percent of the eSports prize pools went to League of Legends. In terms of dollar value, League of Legends’ total prize pool in 2018 amounted to 14.12 million U.S. dollars. While professional League of Legends' players compete via a variety of different tournaments, one of the most recognized tournaments is The World Championship. In fact, the 2016 World Championship was the third most watched eSports event of all time, attracting 43 million unique viewers worldwide. 
 This graph shows a ranking of best-paid musicians worldwide in 2019. Taylor Swift came first with an income of 185 million US dollars, followed by Kanye West and Ed Sheeran. Here you can find a Billboard ranking of highest-paid musicians in the United States (ranked by their U.S. earnings only). Music industry celebrities in the United States - additional information Although the music industry elite consists of a relatively small circle of individuals, there are many ways in which to rank the best, the most popular, the richest or the highest paid musical artists in the United States, according to different criteria. As of 2018 the highest earning female musician was Katy Perry, followed closely by Taylor Swift. Another way in which to test popularity is to look at sales of concert tickets. In 2017, U2 had the most successful music tour in North America, with some 1.5 million tickets sold. In the top five of most successful tours the group was joined by Garth Brooks, Metallica and Luke Bryan. Garth Brooks also featured among the highest earning country musicians of 2018, however lost out to Luke Bryan who topped the ranking with an annual income of 52 million dollars. 
 The homeownership rate in the United States amounted to 65.1 percent in 2019. The homeownership rate is the proportion of occupied households which are occupied by the owners. This reached its peak in 2004 before the 2007-2009 recession hit and decimated the housing market. The rate continued to fall until 2016, but has begun to increase again since then. Homeownership since the recession The rate of homeownership in the U.S. fell in the lead up to the recession and continued to do so until 2016. In spite of this trend, the share of Americans who perceived homeownership as part of their personal American dream remained relatively stable. This suggests that the financial hardship caused by the recession led to the fall in homeownership, rather than a change in opinion about the importance of homeownership itself. What the future holds for homeownership Homeownership trends vary from generation to generation. Homeownership among Americans over 65 years old is declining, whereas most Millennial renters plan to buy a home in the near future. This suggests that homeownership will remain important in the future, as Millennials are forecast to head most households over the next two decades. 
 This statistic displays the monthly exchange rate (as of the end of each month) of the euro to the British pound sterling (EURGBP), according to data from the European Central Bank, from January 2014 to February 2020. The concrete, or point in time, measure shows the exchange rate as of the last day of each month, which is different to the standardized measure; calculation of average based on observations throughout the period in question. Pound fluctuates in uncertainty During the period under observation, the monthly exchange rate of the euro to the British pound fluctuated. In October 2016, the euro to British pound sterling monthly exchange rate was equal to 0.89, which meant that one euro could buy 0.89 British pounds. By August 2017 this value had increased, to 0.92 which meant that one euro could buy 0.92 British pounds. The annual increase in euro to British pound exchange rate is reflected in the annual exchange rate.British pound remains weak Despite the uncertainty over the long-term outcome of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, during the period between July 2019 and January 2020 the euro weakened against the British pound. In January 2020, the euro has also seen a continued downturn against the U.S. dollar. 
 This timeline shows a forecast for global retail sales growth from 2017 to 2023. In 2019, global retail sales were expected to grow by 4.5 percent. Global retail sales were projected to amount to around 29.8 trillion U.S. dollars by 2023, up from approximately 23 trillion U.S. dollars in 2017. American retailers worldwide As a result of globalization and various trade agreements between markets and countries, many retailers are capable of doing business on a global scale. Many of the world’s leading retailers are American companies. Walmart and Amazon are examples of such American retailers. The success of U.S. retailers can also be seen through their performance in online retail. Retail in the U.S. The domestic retail market in the United States is a lucrative market, in which many companies compete. Walmart, a retail chain offering low prices and a wide selection of products, is the leading retailer in the United States. Amazon, The Kroger Co., Costco, and Target are a selection of other leading U.S. retailers. 
 According to a medical analysis based on 44,672 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 in China published in February 2020, most patients aged between 30 and 69 years. Approximately ten percent of the surveyed patients were 29 years old or younger. 
 It has been predicted that by the year 2020 total U.S. expenditure on mental health services will reach some 238 billion dollars. Mental health remains a relevant and difficult issue in the United States. Common mental disorders in the U.S. include anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and dementia. As of 2017, around 15 percent of males and 22 percent of females reported some mental illness in the past year.Depression Depression is one of the most common and well-known mental disorders. Depression is a severe mood disorder marked by extended and persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, hopelessness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness and a loss of interest in hobbies and activities. It is estimated that around 8 percent of adults in the U.S. suffer from depression. Depression is more common among women than men, with around 9.3 percent of women suffering from depression, compared to 5.4 percent of men. Treatment Mental health disorders are usually treated through therapy, medication, or a combination of both, depending on the disorder and severity. Access to quality and inexpensive mental health treatment is essential, but often lacking. As of 2017, the United States had around 11,582 mental health treatment facilities. However, it has been found that around 42 percent of adults with an unmet need for mental health care stated they did not receive mental health services in the past year because they could not afford the cost. 
 The statistic shows global gross domestic product (GDP) from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, global GDP amounted to about 84.93 trillion U.S. dollars. Gross domestic product Gross domestic product, also known as GDP, is the accumulated value of all finished goods and services produced in a country, often measured annually. GDP is significant in determining the economic health, growth and productivity in the country, and is a stat often used when comparing several countries at a time, most likely in order to determine which country has seen the most progress. Global GDP has experienced a growth every year over the past decade with the exception of 2009. However, a strong growth rate does not necessarily lead to all positive outcomes and often has a negative affect on inflation rates. A severe growth in GDP leads to less unemployment, however lower unemployment often leads to higher inflation rates due to demand increasing at a much higher rate than supply and as a result prices rise accordingly. Despite a relatively high global GDP growth, unemployment only marginally changed over the course of 5 years and is forecasted to remain stagnant going into 2017. Unemployment, however, is often difficult to predict, primarily now since most economies are still recovering from the 2008 global financial crisis. 
 Japan’s suicide numbers peaked in 2009, when the country experienced its worst recession since World War II. That year, the suicide rate surged to 25.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and almost 33 thousand victims in total. Despite noticeably decreasing suicide numbers in recent years, Japan still had one of the highest suicide rates among high-income OECD nations. In 2018, the country reported 16.5 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants. What are the reasons behind Japan’s high suicide rates? Historically, Japan’s high suicide rates were closely linked to the economic situation of individuals. While the majority of suicides in Japan stemmed from health reasons, existential worries and problems directly related to work accounted for over 5,000 self-inflicted deaths in 2018. The most profound issue faced by employees in Japan leading to self-harm was exhaustion. An increasing pressure of retaining jobs by putting in more hours of overtime, while taking fewer holidays and sick days were seen as the main motivators behind the rising suicide numbers among office workers and employees. Occupational sudden mortality, known as karoshi ("death by overwork") is a well-known phenomenon in Japanese society. Besides physical pressure, mental stress from the workplace can cause karoshi. Suicide due to occupational stress or overwork is called karojisatsu ("overwork suicide") in Japan. Which demographic groups are affected? While middle-aged men were frequently portrayed as the highest-risk group for suicide in Japan, suicides among elderly and school children were recurrently picked up by media. Financial anxiety, bullying, isolation and the lack of a proficient mental healthcare system were only some of the factors for contributing to the country’s high suicide rates amongst all age groups. 
 There were around 372 new cases of measles in the U.S. in 2018. Measles, also known as rubeola, is an infectious disease that is highly contagious and affects mostly children. Common symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, and a rash. Although death rates from measles have decreased around the world, it is still responsible for around 91,000 deaths worldwide per year. Measles vaccination The main reason for the decrease in measles cases and deaths is due to high vaccination rates. The widely used MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella and is safe and effective. In 2017, around 91.5 percent of children aged 19 to 35 months had received the MMR vaccine. However, in recent years there has been a rise in measles cases in many parts of the world due to vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy Vaccine hesitancy refers to a refusal or reluctance to have children vaccinated despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. This hesitancy comes from a misunderstanding of the ingredients in vaccines and how they work, a mistrust of doctors and pharmaceutical companies, and belief in the unfounded associations of vaccines with other diseases and disorders. Shockingly, a recent survey from Statista found that only 71 percent of U.S. parents felt the measles vaccine was “absolutely necessary”. 
 FB Barcelona was the team that received most live spectators during the 2017/18 season, with over 65.8 thousand fans. Real Madrid followed second with a very similar result, amounting to over 65.6 thousand spectators in 2017/18. The Spanish top division football – commonly known as La Liga among fans – is the Spanish 20-team league system followed by millions in Spain and other countries. Many fans flock into stadiums when a game is on, even though the attendance of live matches has been in decline in the past years. A popular phenomenon on television too Football is quite an event in Spain with broadcast football games traditionally holding the first positions of audience rankings in the Mediterranean country. In fact, football games occupied three of the ten most watched broadcasts in Spain in May 2019, with the Copa del Rey final Valencia vs. Barcelona leading the list with 6.43 million viewers. The popularity of football in Spain can also be sensed when looking at the annual audience list, which, in 2018, was taken up by ten football game broadcasts, partly owing to the FIFA World Cup that took place that year. The Spanish Liga Spaniards are passionate about football, a sport that is often conceived as much more than just an entertainment – it revolves around strong feelings and emotion. It will then come as no surprise that some Spanish football teams not only made the global list of best paid players, but also topped it with its two flagship clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid. The Football Club Barcelona led the list of highest salaries per player in La Liga at 13.76 million U.S. dollars in 2017/18. Real Madrid ranked second, with its average player earning approximately 10.64 million U.S. dollars that year. 
 The statistic ranks the pro male tennis players according to the number of aces served in 2016. John Isner leads all players with a total of 1,159 aces in 50 matches. Most aces in 2015 - additional information In tennis an ace is a legal serve that is not touched by the receiver, thus winning the point for the server. Aces generally occur on a player’s first serve where the server can hit the ball with maximum force and accurate placement. There are several types of aces, including a hard flat serve to either the middle or the corner of the service box and a spin serve out wide. The American John Isner holds the record for the most aces in a single match. He hit 112 aces in a match against Nicolas Mahut (who himself hit 103) in the first round of Wimbledon in 2010. This match was the longest ever played both in terms of time taken (11 hours and 5 minutes) and number of games (183). Second on the list is Milos Raonic, who broke into the top 10 of the ATP Rankings for the first time in 2013 after reaching the fourth round of the Australian Open and the third round of the French Open where he lost to Kevin Anderson (third on the list). Goran Ivanišević holds the record for most aces served in a year with 1,477 in the 1996 season, as well as recording the most aces in a single tournament when he hit 213 on the way to winning Wimbledon in 2001. The fastest ace recorded was by Samuel Groth in 2012 at an ATP Challenger event where he hit a serve at 263km/h. However the ATP does not formally recognize this record and so the official record for the fastest serve is held by Ivo Karlovic with a serve of 251 km/h at the 2011 Davis Cup. Sam Querrey holds the record for consecutive aces with 10 against James Blake in the quarter final at the 2007 Indianapolis Tennis Championships. 
 As of April 1, 2019 the basic annual salary for Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom was just over 79 thousand British pounds This marked an increase of just over 13.7 thousand pounds when compared with April 2012, when MPs earned 65.7 thousand a year. Comparison with average earnings In 2018 the median earnings for full-time workers was 29.57 thousand pounds a year, meaning MPs earned almost 50 thousand more than the average worker that year. Whether or not MPs deserve to earn almost three times that national average is up for debate, although it must be said this is not decided by MPs themselves. Since 2011 decisions regarding MPs pay and expenses lie with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). House of Commons demographics After the 2017 General Elections most MPs were aged between 40 and 59, with only fourteen of them in their twenties or younger. In terms of gender, there are almost two male MPs for every one woman, although this is a much better than in 1979 when only 3 percent of MPs were women. 
 In 2019, a total of 786 movies were released in the United States and Canada, over 90 fewer than were released in the previous year. The biggest hit in 2019 was Marvel movie 'Avengers: Endgame', which outpaced James Cameron's 'Avatar' as the highest grossing film ever made with almost 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in global box office revenue. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has enjoyed impressive box office revenues in recent years with the success of 'Black Panther', 'Avengers: Infinity War', and 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to name but a few. Whilst the number of movies released domestically in 2019 was much lower than in 2018, overall box office revenues for the year were relatively similar, although the figure dropped below 11 billion U.S. dollars for the first time since 2014. 
How much are acrylic nails in the U.S.? Nail salons in the U.S. charged an average price of 46.01 U.S. dollars for a full set of acrylics in 2019. Nail salons in the U.S. The nail salon industry in the United States is a large and thriving industry, which is active across all 50 states. However, the accessibility and types of clients have changed drastically since the early 20th century. In the early 1900s, nail salons were accessible to only wealthy women. Over the next two decades, it became possible to buy nail polish in stores. Having a manicured hand was a sign of wealth and social status during that time period. In today’s society, manicures and pedicures are available to everyone. As a result of this, there has been an increased amount of spending on nail salon services from 1998. However, the number of nail salons in the United States has decreased since 2006. On the other hand, the number of nail technicians has increased. Manicurists and pedicurists make about one third of what theatrical and performance makeup artists make, who are the highest paid employees in personal appearance services in the United States. Nail services Acrylics are one of the many services offered at nail salons. Acrylic nails are a mix of powder and liquid product, which are shaped into a soft ball and then formed into a nail shape. The acrylic is applied to the nail then hardened to become stronger, then painted with nail polish. The average price for an acrylic fill has steadily increased from 2006 to 2019. Acrylic nail upkeep requires coming to the nail salon about every two weeks. 
 In 2018, the finance, real estate, insurance, rental, and leasing industry added the most value to the GDP to the United States in 2018. In that year, this industry added 4.23 trillion U.S. dollars to the national GDP. Gross Domestic Product Gross domestic product is a measure of how much a country produces in a certain amount of time. Countries with a high GDP tend to have large economies, for example, the United States. However, GDP does not take into consideration the cost of living and inflation rates, so it cannot be used to calculate the standard of living. U.S. GDP California added the largest amount of value to the real GDP of the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019. Following California was Texas and New York. In California, New York, and Texas, the finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing industry added the most value to the state GDP. While the business sector added the highest value to the U.S. real GDP in 2018, it was the information industry that had the biggest percentage change in value added to the GDP between 2010 and 2018. 
 As of 2005, people in the United States stated that they have had an average of 10.7 sexual partners, which is slightly above the global average of nine sexual partners. Turkey in the lead? Surveys on sensitive or very personal topics, like sexuality, are often to be taken with a grain of salt, but in this case, Turkey did not only lead the ranking in 2005, it also topped the one conducted in 2010 on the mean number of sexual partners. So is it likely that the Turkish people are sexually more prolific than everybody else? Another survey by another source suggests otherwise: It does not include Turkey when it comes to the countries with the most sexually active inhabitants but lists the Greek as the most active ones. In general, people tend to embellish their own activities, but also those of others – the disparity between the perceived and the actual number of times people have sex is staggering and similar everywhere around the world. India the most monogamous? Of those countries surveyed, Indian respondents report the lowest average number of sexual partners, only slightly surpassed by China. Both China and India struggle with a significant difference between the number of men and the number of women, and both countries largely adhere to conservative standards of sexuality that prohibit sex before marriage. 
 The United States was the leading exporter of cotton worldwide in 2018/2019. In that time period, the U.S. cotton industry had an export volume of 3.21 million metric tons. Cotton products Cotton is one of the most versatile and widely used materials. It is one of the most popular textiles in the clothing manufacturing industry, as well as a common material in paper products. Medical gauze, cotton swabs and rounds, and traditional diapers are all made using cotton. In addition, cottonseed oil is derived from cotton plants and can be used for cooking, soap making, or cosmetics. In 2018/2019, around 5.2 million metric tons of cottonseed oil was produced worldwide. Cotton production in the U.S. The area planted with cotton in the United States has increased between 2015 and 2019. In the 2015/2016 crop year, some 8.42 million acres of cotton were planted in the United States, and by 2018/2019 this figure is expected to increase to 13.85 million acres. The U.S. state with the most cotton production is Texas. Georgia came in second among the leading cotton producers in the United States. 
 This statistic shows the leading egg producing countries worldwide in 2018. In China, some 458 billion eggs were produced in that year. Egg production Eggs belong to the animal product category. They are laid by female animals. The most common types for human consumption include eggs laid by chickens, ducks, quail, roe and caviar. Bird and reptile eggs consist of an egg yolk and an egg white and a protective egg shell. Egg varieties carried by retailers include brown- and white-colored eggs. They are further classified by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) based on the internal quality and their external appearance. Grades to be distinguished between include Grade AA, Grade A, and Grade B eggs. In the European Union, eggs are not graded by their quality but on their used farming method (organic or conventional, free range, barn range). Eggs are a common food used in a large variety of dishes as they are a large supplier of protein and other valuable minerals and vitamins. On the breakfast table, they may be enjoyed –depending on the region – as a scrambled egg, hard-boiled egg or as a fried egg with the ‘sunny side up’.
 This statistic represents the leading countries in biofuel production in 2018. In Germany, production reached around 3.4 million metric tons of oil equivalent that year. That means, Germany is among the global top three countries in biofuel production. The volume of biodiesel production in the United States can be found here. Biofuel production in the U.S.Biofuels are characterized by fuels that obtain their energy through the process of biological carbon fixation. These hydrocarbons are made by or from living organisms in a relatively short period of time - in comparison to the formation of fossil fuels which requires millions of years. The United States was by far one of the largest producers of biofuel in the world in 2018, accounting for 39.9 percent of global biofuel production. The country produced 35 million metric tons of oil equivalents in this year, while Brazil produced 22.4 million metric tons of oil equivalents. Global biofuel production has gradually increased from 9.2 million metric tons of oil equivalents in 2000 to 95.37 million metric tons of oil equivalents in 2018. Biofuels are commonly used as part of mixtures with fossil fuel sources or as additives. One of the largest consumers of biofuels in the U.S. is the national army. Many vehicles can be fueled using blends containing up to 10 percent ethanol. In the beginning of the 20th century, many Ford T models were fueled with ethanol. Biofuels can also be generated through the consumption or conversion of biomass material. This conversion can occur thermally, chemically, or biochemically. Biomass consumption in the United States totaled 5,196 trillion British thermal units in 2018. 
 In March 2018, cloud-based mobile messaging app Telegram reported 200 million monthly active users worldwide. Telegram is a chat app focused on user privacy, message encryption and delivery speed. Telegram In 2013, Telegram was launched by the brothers Nikolai and Pavel Durov. The pair had previously founded the Russian social network VK, which they left when it was taken over by the Mail.ru Group. As of April 2019, Telegram ranked among the leading mobile messenger apps worldwide. The app is not particularly popular in the United States, reaching only 1.4 percent of U.S. mobile audiences in October 2018. However, Telegram has been making inroads in many European markets and is one of the most frequently used mobile messaging apps in Germany. Telegram security criticism Despite claiming to be more secure than other mainstream messengers such as LINE or Whatsapp, Telegram has been frequently criticized by industry experts such as German consumer organization Stiftung Warentest or the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). One of the key points of criticism is Telegram’s failure to provide automatic end-to-end encryption (WhatsApp and LINE messenger have end-to-end encryption set up by default). The company has also promised to release the coding for all its applications so security specialists could verify that it is working correctly and handling user data in a secure manner. However, as of May 2019 Telegram has failed to publish the server-side code for auditing. 
 This graph depicts the average regular season home attendance of the Seattle Seahawks from 2008 to 2019. In 2019, the average attendance at home games of the Seattle Seahawks was 68,990. Seattle Seahawks average home attendance - additional information The Seattle Seahawks’ average regular season home attendance has remained relatively constant in recent years, with the average in the 2019 season standing at 68,990. This figure puts the team almost above average compared to the entire NFL average, which was recorded as 66,151 in 2019. The Dallas Cowboys were the best supported team throughout the 2019 regular season as an average of over 90,000 fans watched each of their home games. The average attendance of the Seahawks was ranked 15th out of the 32 teams in the NFL. A total of 16.67 million people attended regular season games in the 2019 NFL season, over 551,000 of whom passed through the gates of CenturyLink Field, home of the Seahawks. Each of these Seahawks fans paid an average of 111.79 U.S. dollars to watch their team in the 2019 season, a figure that increased from under 97 U.S. dollars for the previous season. The Seahawks have enjoyed considerable success in recent years, making the playoffs in the 2010 and 2012 seasons. The franchise then went on to win Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014, beating the Denver Broncos 43-8. This marked the team’s first Super Bowl win in its history, having previously lost Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2005. CenturyLink Field was opened as the Seahawks Stadium in July 2002 but was renamed Qwest Field in June 2004 when the telecommunications carrier acquired the naming rights. Its current name was adopted in June 2011 after the takeover of Qwest by CenturyLink. It is also home to MLS team, Seattle Sounders FC, which began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. 
 This statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) in France from 1984 to 2018, with a projection up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. In 2018, the GDP in France was around 2.78 trillion U.S. dollars. Economy of France France is an economically developed nation and one of the members of the G7. France is also considered to be one of the leading countries in Europe, often seen as the second most important nation in the European Union behind Germany. France has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP), being one of the top 10 countries with the largest GDP in the world in 2014. Despite this, the country is still ranked in the top 20 in regards to its public debt compared to its GDP in the same year. A high debt-to-GDP ratio demonstrates a country’s ability to produce and sell goods and services in order to be able to pay back its debts, however producing and selling these goods should not result in more debts. France’s national debt slightly increased year-over-year up until 2014, most notably between 2008 and 2009. Additionally, France reported a large trade deficit in 2012, a value almost 5 times larger compared to the previous year, indicating that the country is importing much more than it is exporting. This often leads to higher debts due to a need to borrow more money to produce goods. 
How many registered motor vehicles are there in the U.S.? Some 272.48 million vehicles were registered here in 2017. The figures include passenger cars, motorcycles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles. The number of cars sold in the U.S. per year stood at 6.3 million in 2016. U.S. vehicle registrations Second only to China, the United States is one of the world’s largest automobile markets based on the number of new light vehicle registrations, with around 17.55 million new light vehicle registrations in 2016. However, of the 68.6 million passenger cars produced worldwide in 2016, less than four million automobiles were produced in the U.S. While the United States imports a significant amount of vehicles from various countries such as Japan, Mexico and Canada, passenger car assembly within the country increased from some 2.2 million units produced in 2009 to a little under four million units in 2016. Toyota and BMW are the leading carmakers selling imported cars in the United States. Leading car manufacturers in the United States The leading car manufacturers overall in the United States include the Detroit Big Three automakers: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler; today, Chrysler is fully owned by Fiat though. With respect to car brands, the Ford brand clocked in at number one in 2016, selling around 2.5 million vehicles in the United States alone. The brand's holding company is the Ford Motor Company; it was founded by Henry Ford in 1903 in Dearborn, Michigan. The company pioneered in large-scale car manufacturing and introduced production methods such as the assembly line. Ford is one of the world’s largest automobile manufacturers, with 2016 revenue of just under 152 billion U.S. dollars. 
 This statistic represents the number of bus registrations in the United States in 2017, by federal state, including the District of Columbia. With around 99,900 registered buses, California was ranked first. 
 This statistic shows the national debt of Ireland from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the national debt of Ireland was around 226.92 billion U.S. dollars. For comparison, the Greek debt amounted to approximately 303 billion euros that same year. In a ranking of debt to GDP per country, Ireland is thus currently ranked tenth, while Greece is ranked second. Ireland and the economic crisis Ireland has been severely affected by the economic crisis owing mainly to the bursting of its real estate bubble in 2007. The crisis led to a dramatic decline in real estate prices and was a major factor in the financial and banking crisis, causing Ireland to enter recession in 2008 – which means that the economy underwent a period of decline, unemployment figures soared, numerous bankruptcies resulted and many businesses were forced into closure, and inflation and GDP declined. Ireland’s budget balance seems to be in remission from a severe state deficit in 2010. It continues to show negative figures to this day. Ireland was not the only country to be hit severely by the economic crisis, other countries are also suffering: Portugal, for example, reported an ever higher national debt than Ireland in 2012 and an even higher state deficit. Spain is another casualty; it has been reporting extraordinarily high unemployment figures since 2008, the rate of unemployment is still on the rise . The country suffering most due to the economic crisis, however, was and still is Greece, with a national debt almost one-and-a-half times as large as Ireland’s at times, and an unemployment rate to rival that of Spain, as well as a devastated economy. As for Ireland, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) agreed to support the country financially with a loan in 2010. However, the country is still not out of recession and might struggle to secure economic recovery for another few years at least. 
 The statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Canada from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the gross domestic product per capita in Canada was around 46,290.22 U.S. dollars. Canada's economy GDP per capita is a measurement often used to determine economic growth and potential increases in productivity and is calculated by taking the GDP and dividing it by the total population in the country. In 2014, Canada had one of the largest GDP per capita values in the world, a value that has grown continuously since 2010 after experiencing a slight downturn due to the financial crisis of 2008. Canada is seen as one of the premier countries in the world, particularly due to its strong economy and healthy international relations, most notably with the United States. Canada and the United States have political, social and economical similarities that further strengthen their relationship. The United States was and continues to be Canada’s primary and most important trade partner and vice versa. Canada’s economy is partly supported by its exports, most notably crude oil, which was the country’s largest export category. Canada was also one of the world’s leading oil exporters in 2013, exporting more than the United States. Additionally, Canada was also a major exporter of goods such as motor vehicles and mechanical appliances, which subsequently ranked the country as one of the world’s top export countries in 2013. 
India’s share of global gross domestic product (GDP) rose to 7.74 percent in 2018 when adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) and was projected to increase to 9.58 percent by 2024. This reflects the growth of India’s economy, which is helped in this ranking by the low purchasing power of the rupee. The Indian economy A significant portion of India’s economic growth comes from a shift in the workforce from the agricultural sector to the more-productive service sector. This labor force shift is particularly significant in India because of the country’s staggering population figures. As such, changes in the Indian economy have an impact on a significant portion of the world population. What does PPP mean? The Economist magazine uses the Big Mac Index to illustrate purchasing power. Since the product should be the same in every country that has a McDonalds, the Big Mac’s price should reflect the purchasing power of each local currency. For the calculation in this statistic, economists took the prices of several standard goods (though not the Big Mac) and put them at the same level based on their prices in the local currency. Thus, the power of these currencies to purchase was put on par across countries, giving purchasing power parity. As such, this statistic can be interpreted as the relative size of the Indian economy if the whole world used the Indian rupee price levels. 
 Between 1990 and 2019, the film studio with the most ‘Best Picture’ Academy Awards was Universal, having won five awards over the twenty year period.

 The countries with the highest prevalence of multiple sclerosis include Canada, San Marino, Denmark, and Sweden. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects communication in parts of the nervous system and damages the brain and spinal cord. Some of those with MS eventually become disabled due to the disease, but many can still walk, if not with the aid of a cane or crutches. Symptoms Symptoms of MS frequently affect movement, and can cause vision problems, slurred speech, fatigue, and trouble with coordination. Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person and people with MS may experience periods where symptoms improve partially or completely and then relapse. The most common symptoms that keep those with MS from working include fatigue, difficulty walking, standing and moving around, weakness, and cognitive impairment. Impact of MS Multiple sclerosis can impact the lives of those living with the disease in many ways. A survey from 2018 of people suffering from MS found that 24 percent stated they had chosen to stop working due to the disease, while 13 percent lost their job and 12 percent had to take medical leave. MS can also impact the personal and intimate lives of those who suffer. The same survey found 38 percent of respondents said fatigue from MS negatively impacted their sex life.
 This graph shows the average age of cars on the road in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2000 and 2016, including projections for 2015 and 2016. It can be seen that before the recession the average age of cars in the UK was falling, however, since the recession the average age has risen drastically and will probably continue to rise. These figures show that people were preferring to hold onto their cars for longer rather than sell them to buy new cars. Comparing the projected average age of cars on the road in the UK in 2015 with the average age of light commercial vehicles and the average age of buses in use in Great Britain in 2015, shows that the average age of these vehicles is slightly higher than the age of cars on the road. On the other hand, the average age of auctioned cars in the UK in 2015 was slightly lower than the average age of cars on the road in 2015. 
 Serena Williams has won the most Grand Slam titles of all time during her career, with a total of 23 Grand Slam tournament victories. She pulled clear of Steffi Graf to take the overall lead in the rankings after her success at the 2017 Australian Open, in which she beat her sister, Venus Williams, in the final. Queens of the court Serena Williams is undoubtedly one of the best female tennis players of all time. Of her 23 Grand Slam titles to date, seven each came at the Australian Open and at Wimbledon.

 Founded in Sweden in 2003, King is a video game developer that is most famous for its blockbuster gaming hit, Candy Crush Saga. The developer’s revenue reached two billion U.S. dollars in 2018, a marked increase from revenue of less than 60 million U.S. dollars in 2010. King of the developers In its early years in the social gaming world, King relied on in-game advertising and micro-transactions to generate revenue. The latter enabled players to make in-game purchases to improve their virtual world or help them past a particularly tricky level. However, in a move to win over its legion of fans, the company decided to remove all in-game advertising in June 2013 and focused on micro-transactions to bring in the money. This strategy seemed to pay off as the monthly active users of King continued to increase and peaked at 550 million users at the beginning of 2015. However, the MAU figure has been steadily falling in the ensuing years and the company was acquired in February 2016 by Activision Blizzard, famed for games such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch, in a deal worth almost six billion U.S. dollars. The publisher has since seen an upturn in its fortunes and registered record operating income of 750 million U.S. dollars in 2018. Candy Crush Saga – King’s jewel in the crown The more than tenfold increase of King’s revenue between 2012 and 2013 is down to just one game – Candy Crush Saga. The colorful puzzle game became an overnight sensation and could be seen on smartphones across the world. While the game itself is free-to-play, users have the option of making in-game purchases to help them get past certain levels. This is where King’s micro-transaction revenue model truly paid off as player spending in Candy Crush mobile games worldwide reached over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Despite the fast-paced nature of mobile gaming and the new releases that hit our screens every day, Candy Crush Saga still remains one of the most popular free-to-play games on the market. 
 The statistic depicts the average inflation rate in Mexico from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate measures price changes for a fixed basket of goods which includes a representative selection of goods and services. In 2018, Mexico's average inflation rate was around 4.9 percent compared to the previous year. Mexico’s economy Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP) has been increasing slightly over the last decade, however, its national debt still amounts to almost half of its GDP. The majority of Mexico’s GDP is yielded by the services sector, as a look at the distribution of gross domestic product in Mexico by sector shows. More than 60 percent of GDP are generated in this sector; the majority of the Mexican workforce is employed in services. One important contributor to Mexico’s GDP is tourism. The total unemployment rate in Mexico took a turn for the worse during the recession of 2008 and is still to bounce back to previous levels. Mexico’s main export and import partner is the United States which accounts for approximately half of the value of both. Thus, the trade balance of goods in Mexico, showing the value of exports minus the value of imports, is heavily dependant on the United States. For the past decade, Mexico’s trade balance has run at a deficit of more than 10 billion US dollars. The trade balance of services sector in Mexico has also been in the red with a deficit of more than 6 percent since the recession and higher than 9 percent since 2011. Mexico is also one of the largest drug exporting countries worldwide. Specific trade figures are not available, however, Mexico is among the top countries for opium cultivation based on acreage, and thousands of illegal poppy fields, processed into opium, have been destroyed in Mexico year after year. 
 Born between the mid-1980s and the late 1990s, there were approximately 12 million millennials in the United Kingdom in 2018. This generation, sometimes called Generation Y came after Generation X and are mainly the children of the post-war baby-boomer generation. Although sometimes portrayed negatively in the media, millennials are also seen as an inclusive and confident, with a genuine concern for equal rights. Boomerang generation The first cohort of millennials came of age at the turn of the century and have almost certainly been heavily influenced by the growth of internet accessibility during this time. The economic challenges faced by this generation may have a relation to the increasing share of young adults who live with their parents in the UK. This had led to the, perhaps unfair, characterization of millennials as the boomerang or peter-pan generation, who have failed to grow-up and mature. Generation Remain One of the main challenges that British millennials currently face are their prospects after Brexit. Although the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in June of 2016, there were clear divisions between regions, classes and age-groups. Most millennials voted to remain in the Brexit referendum with 80 percent females aged between 18 to 24 voting to stay in the E.U.

Terrorism is practiced by nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. The fear of terrorism is still instilled in many people's minds. According to Gallup’s survey, which was conducted among adults in the United States in 2013, 34 percent of the participants stated that they were very worried about the possibility of future terrorist attacks. Only 10 percent of the participants said that they were not at all worried.

 In 2018, insurance penetration reached 20.88 percent in Taiwan. Insurance penetration is used as an indicator of insurance sector development within a country and is calculated as the ratio of total insurance premiums to gross domestic product in a given year. Thus, the value of insurance premiums written in Taiwan in 2018 equaled more than one fifth of the region’s GDP. FSC concern over high penetration rate Taiwan’s high insurance penetration rate has led to the region’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to encourage the public to ensure that their insurance coverage fits their needs. Taiwan’s GDP has been increasing since 2016 and this trend is set to continue through 2024. Taiwan’s insurance market The number of property and casualty companies in Taiwan has remained steady over the past decade, whereas the life insurance market has experienced more fluctuation. The country’s population has been gradually climbing over the past decade, which means that the number of potential insurance customers has also been increasing. 
 Light truck retail sales in the United States increased to 12.2 million units in 2019, the highest level on record. This number has been increasing since 2010, when the auto industry began recovering from low vehicle purchases during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In 2018, sales of light trucks accounted for about 72 percent of the approximately 17 million light vehicles sold in the United States. Ford, with its signature truck, the Ford F-150, is the leading North American car brand in the United States. Why are consumers buying trucks now? The U.S. economy has largely recovered from the woes of the financial crisis and unemployment rates fell to 3.7 percent in 2019. This, coupled with a low unemployment rate, means that consumers are better able to purchase new vehicles. Similarly, due to lower gasoline and diesel fuel prices, motorists are more willing to buy trucks over smaller, more fuel-efficient sedans. 
 In 2020, the global market for RFID tags is projected to be sized at around 24.5 billion U.S. dollars. Retail applications are expected to account for the largest share of the market. Projected size of the global market for RFID tags The abbreviation RFID stands for radio-frequency identification, a technology that can be classified as a sub-group of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technologies. The large-scale commercialization of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication has stirred a fourth industrial revolution lately, and RFID tags are vital to what was dubbed Industry 4.0 by Siemens and Internet of Things by General Electric. These tags are key components in an increasingly connected, digitized world. In the realm of smart infrastructure, items such as clothes, cash or pharmaceuticals can be identified and tracked in real time with the help of RFID tags. As a result, supply chains may become more efficient and product customization may be taken to the next level. However, in light of sluggish RFID adoption, about 99 percent of the available market remains untapped today. The majority of businesses are likely reluctant to employ RFID tagging because the use of RFID tags is by no means risk-free. The RFID tags in combination with integrated manufacturing execution systems (MES) may open the door to hackers, threaten a company’s information security and spur cyber crime.

In the third quarter of 2019, 247 million people accessed the mobile gaming company's apps per month. Popular titles include Candy Crush Saga, Farm Ville Saga as well as Bubble Witch Saga, all of which are monetized through in-game purchases. King's gaming apps are available on Facebook as well as on mobile platforms. In 2014, King reached record high revenue in its history, having generated 2.26 billion U.S. dollars that year. Two years later, in February 2016, the company was acquired by Activision Blizzard, as part of a deal worth 5.9 billion U.S. dollars. 
 As of July 2019, the United States had the highest number of incarcerated individuals worldwide, with about 2.12 million people in prison. The U.S. was followed by China, Brazil, the Russian Federation, and India. The incarceration problem The United States has an incredibly high number of incarcerated individuals. Therefore, the incarceration problem has become a widely contested issue, because it impacts disadvantaged people and minorities the most. Additionally, the prison system has become capitalized by outside corporations which fund prisons, but there is still a high cost to tax-payers. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the amount of private prisons that have been created. For-profit prison companies have come under scrutiny because of their lack of satisfactory staff and widespread lobbying. Violent offenses are the most common type of offense among prisoners in the U.S. Prisoners in the U.S. Within OECD countries, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration worldwide, at 655 prisoners per 100,000 residents. This is almost double that of Turkey, the country with the second highest incarceration rate. Within in the United States, Texas had the highest number of prisoners under federal or state jurisdiction, however, it was California that spent the most on corrections. 
 Over 2,300 homicides were gang-related in the United States in 2012. This was the highest amount since 2007 and a reversal of a negative trend from the previous two years. Violent crime Violent crime in the United States is not limited to gang violence, but the murders in this statistic compose a significant portion of the number of reported murders in those years. While there were many arrests for violent offenses in those years, few were gang members. Still, gang-related violence is a serious problem. Ways to die Gang-related killings are among the top circumstances for murders in the United States. Also enlightening is the number of murder victims by weapon. The vast majority of U.S. murder victims were killed by handguns or a type of firearm. The source does not give how many murders were averted by guns. 
 This statistic shows the top 50 female tennis players worldwide in the WTA Ranking as of February 2020. The best-ranked player is Ashleigh Barty from Australia with 8,387 points.

Steffi Graf holds the record for the most weeks at number one, with 377 weeks. She also is the player with the most consecutive weeks at the top of the rankings, spending 186 weeks in a row in the top spot from August 17, 1987 to March 10, 1991. Steffi Graf was ranked number one at year-end a total of eight times. The WTA, short for Women’s Tennis Association, is the governing body of women’s professional tennis. It was founded in 1973 by Billie Jean King, one of the most successful pro tennis players of all time, having won a total of 39 Grand Slam titles. 
 During an September 2019 survey, it was found that 25 percent of teens in the United States used Instagram the most out of all social networks. This is hardly surprising, as U.S. teens rated Instagram among their favorite social network for the past few years. In spring 2019, 35 percent of teenagers ranked the photo-sharing app as their most important social network. Teens and social media in the United States As evidenced by exasperated parents and teachers everywhere, social media is one of the most popular online activities among teenagers in the United States. Despite the near-constant social media usage, teens are usually reasonably aware of the time they spent online. During an April 2018 survey, 54 and 41 percent of responding teens stated that they spent too much time on their cellphone and on social media respectively. Due to constant interaction with other people online, teens come across a wide range of personalities. The most common personality types that teens come across social media are oversharers (people who share too many personal details on social media) and ranters (people who rant and complain about things a lot). Social media and emotional well-being One of the key benefits of social media is that it can make teenagers feel less lonely and more confident and popular. However, with teens who have a low social-emotional well-being, social media can exacerbate pre-existing problems such as feeling left out or being excluded, as well as feeling bad about themselves when their posts did not get enough likes or comments. In the end, online socializing can make up for the lack of friends IRL (in real life) but it can also make things worse for teens who are already in emotional turmoil.

 Mass media corporation 21st Century Fox generated 30.4 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in the fiscal year 2018, up from 28.5 billion U.S. dollars in the previous year. The company made over half of its revenue in cable network programming in 2018 and a further 8.75 billion U.S. dollars was derived from its filmed entertainment segment. The acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney 21st Century Fox consisted of News Corporations's former TV and film divisions after the split from the News Corp. in June 2013. In 2017, it was announced that Disney was making plans to acquire assets from 21st Century Fox’s entertainment and broadcast/satellite divisions. The acquisition was completed after a brief but high-profile bidding war between rivals Disney and Comcast, the latter of which ended its part in the proceedings by announcing the company would instead continue to seek stakes in Sky. Disney completed its acquisition of the company’s film and entertainment assets in early 2019 for around 71 billion U.S. dollars, also taking over 20th Century Fox, the movie studio responsible for the X-Men Universe as well as both ‘Avatar’ movies. There have been concerns regarding Disney’s increasing domination over the Hollywood landscape and the company’s unquenchable desire for expansion – Disney is even due to release its own streaming service to rival Netflix in 2019. 
 Costco is headquartered in the U.S. and is a large retailer operating warehouse club stores around the world. Canada’s most populous province of Ontario was home to 36 Costco warehouses in Canada as of December 2019, whilst there was just one warehouse in Newfoundland and Labrador. The warehouse club business model Warehouse clubs offer a more limited range of products than a traditional supermarket and aim to attract shoppers who wish to save money by buying in bulk. Shoppers must become a member and pay a fee to be able to shop in Costco’s warehouses. Almost 95 million people worldwide were Costco members in 2018. There are different tiers of membership, all of which enable members to use any Costco warehouse worldwide and online. Other warehouse club retailers with stores in Canada include Sam’s Club and BJ’s wholesale. Brick-and-mortar reigns over e-commerce Costco offers an online shopping service, which can be a convenient and time-saving shopping option; however, the majority of Canadian consumers still spend more on groceries in-store than online. The main reasons preventing consumers from buying groceries online include a lack of interest and shipping and service costs.

 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Swiss franc (EUR CHF), according to data from the European Central Bank, from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until 2019. The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: this denotes concrete values as of specific day (i.e. end of the year). Between the years of 2002 and 2007, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Swiss franc noted an increase. In 2007, the euro to Swiss franc annual average exchange rate was equal to 1.64, which meant that one euro could buy 1.64 Swiss francs. By 2019, this value had decreased overall, to a value of 1.11 which meant that one euro could buy 1.11 Swiss francs. This decrease in average annual euro to Swiss franc exchange rate is reflected in the monthly exchange rate, measured as of end-of-month in recent years. 
 This statistic illustrates the number of Vodafone employees worldwide from 2009 to 2019. Altogether there were 92,005 Vodafone employees in 2019. 
 Volkswagen’s operating profit rose 0.7 percent in 2018 over the previous year and now stands at a record 13.92 billion euros. Since the costly diesel scandal, Volkswagen’s reputation seems to have recovered and many performance indicators are now above pre-scandal figures. This is impressive considering that in both 2017 and 2018, the company had significant one-off costs related to the diesel scandal. The automotive industry in the United States may be struggling to sell new sedans, including about 80 percent of Volkswagen models, but VW has much larger markets in Europe and the Asia Pacific. Both regions are increasing in deliveries and revenue. Consequently, VW’s operating profit is expected to increase between 6.5 and 7.5 percent year-on-year. These expectations are a sign of great confidence despite volatile global exchange rates and upcoming changes in European engine emissions regulation. Scandal and recovery The German car manufacturing group had suffered a major hit in 2015, after it came to light that many of its diesel engine vehicles did not meet U.S. clean air targets, and engines and test results had been tampered with. In attempt to rectify the issue, the company announced they would spend 16.2 billion euros recalling and buying back vehicles, as well as implementing new equipment. As a result of their fraudulent activity, Volkswagen were given a 2.8 billion U.S. dollar fine from the United States with more private and governmental action lawsuits to be launched across the globe. In light of the scandal, the reputation of VW dropped substantially, and the company is expected to lose out on 200 billion U.S. dollars in sales over a ten-year period to 2025. That said, the company is back on its feet for now. In fact, the VW Golf was the highest selling car in Europe between July and December of 2018 - and the third highest selling was the VW Polo. 
 This statistic shows the number of U.S. soldier fatalities in the Iraq War in the period between 2003 and 2019. As of June 2019, eight U.S. soldiers died in Iraq. Additional information on fatalities in the Iraq War The invasion of Iraq by the United States and coalition forces in March 2003 saw the beginning of the Iraq War, a conflict that would continue beyond the end of the decade. Fatalities of American forces were highest in the first five years of conflict as soldiers grappled with the Al Qaeda as well as civil war between those groups seeking to fill the power vacuum left by the removal of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Casualties progressively decreased from 2008, in part due to attempts by Barack Obama who made the removal of troops from Iraq a central promise of this successful campaign to succeed George W. Bush. In 2013, the majority of Americans considered sending troops to fight in Iraq to be a mistake. While the number of civilian deaths in the Iraq War was much higher, the trend of numbers decreasing from 2008 onward was in line with the trend for American solider loses. However, civilian deaths rose again from 2013 onward as Iraq returned to heavy conflict with Islamic State. The high number of American fatalities in the first five years of the Iraq War could be seen as influencing the reluctance of the United States to commit ground troop support in the battle against Islamic State when the issue was discussed in 2015. Not only is the loss of life a tragedy in itself, but the political discourse in the United States surrounding the involvement of their troops in Middle Eastern conflicts has made further involvement unattractive to elected officials. However calls for further ground support are likely to continue as Iraq remained the country with the most terrorist attacks as of 2017. 
 The statistic shows the unemployment rate in Switzerland from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, Switzerland's unemployment rate amounted to around 4.87 percent. Switzerland's economy Due to a fairly prosperous and stable economy, Switzerland has essentially become the world’s investment safe haven over the past several decades and one of the globally leading economical leaders. Switzerland primarily thrives due to its services sector, which partially profits from large amounts of tourism, as well as from its manufacturing sector. Due to the country’s low population, Switzerland has simultaneously maintained a low unemployment rate. The majority of employed workers in the country possess a relatively high level of education and are specialized, which essentially allows for the country to offer high end jobs with higher wages, and often guarantees a higher level of productivity and efficiency. As a result, Swiss adults have on average the most amount of money compared to the average amount around the world, beating out countries such as the United States. Despite experiencing the early 2000s recession, 2008 global financial crisis as well as the Eurozone crisis, Switzerland has still sustained a high production of goods and services within the country, being ranked as one of the most efficient and productive countries in the world). Additionally, Swiss households are made up of one of the highest percentages of millionaires in the world, which is made possible by the country’s low tax rates. 
 During this period the overall price of electricity for households in Sweden increased. From a low of 18.39 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in the first half of 2010, prices reached 20.15 euro cents at the beginning of 2019. Prices peaked in the first half of 2013 at 21 euro cents. Households with an annual consumption of 2,500 to 5,000 kWh paid 19.65 euro cents per kWh in 2017. In comparison, those with a consumption of up to 2,499 kWh paid 22.12 euro cents. European comparisons In 2018, Swedish households enjoyed relatively low prices when compared with the rest of Europe, especially Nordic neighbor Denmark. Prices there were more than 10 U.S cents more expensive per kilowatt-hour than in Sweden. Renewable energy’s impact on prices Sweden’s comparatively low electricity prices are down to several factors, such as a decrease in final electricity demand and increased generation from renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. Both renewable sources have seen production increase significantly in recent years, with solar production reaching 400 gigawatt-hours in 2018, compared to 21.4 in 2012.

 The statistic shows the gross domestic product (GDP) in the European Union from 2008 to 2018. GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country within a year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. In 2018, the GDP in the EU amounted to around 15.89 trillion euros. The financial crisis and its aftermath The European Union is a union made up of 28 states located within and around Europe, including several of the world’s largest economies. Since its inception in 1993, the European Union has displayed the benefits of uniting several countries together, however have also showed possible consequences. The majority of European countries felt the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and furthermore the Eurozone crisis, which has had a severe and continuous effect on the general European economy. Additionally, due to the close association between all the countries, several banks around different European countries were forced to shut down. A generally lower standard of life in the EU, particularly around 2009 during the prime of both economical disasters, led to doubt and uncertainty about the future of many European families and consumers. However, as the economic situation all around the world slowly improved, so did the outlook on the future for most consumers. Struggles around Europe resulted in a larger need to stimulate the economy, which was only possible by borrowing and spending more money. As a result, national debt soared. It was also necessary for more economically successful countries to help finance countries that were deep in the crisis, such as Greece. 
 In 2018, the inflation rate in Denmark amounted to 0.71 percent compared to the previous year. Forecasts see it rising to around two percent, the rate of inflation considered stable by economists. Denmark’s economy in short Denmark is a market economy with a consistent trade surplus, with most of its workforce employed in the services sector. It relies on foreign trade and exports mostly chemicals, agricultural products, and machinery. Denmark is not part of the euro area and thus has kept its currency, the Danish krone. Nevertheless, it was hit by the recession of 2008 and 2009, but has recovered quite well. Everything’s stable in the state of Denmark Despite a slump during the economic crisis around 2008 and 2009, Denmark’s economy is considered to be thriving. Key economic indicators all point to a bright future: Unemployment has been decreasing for the last few years, GDP growth has been steady, and additionally, Denmark scored quite high on the Human Development Index (HDI) – a sure sign that economy and living conditions in the country are stable. 
 In 2019, the U.S. government had a budget deficit of 0.53 trillion U.S. dollars. This is compared to 2000, when the government had a budget surplus of 0.24 trillion U.S. dollars. U.S. Government budget The government budget is a financial statement that demonstrates the government’s suggested revenues and spending for the financial year. Budget surpluses occur when income exceeds expenditures. Budget deficits occur when spending exceeds income. The budget balance of the U.S. government has fluctuated slightly since 2014, and is expected to decrease slightly by 2025. Military spending Defense outlays in the United States amounted to 621.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. It is expected to continue to increase over the next several years. The United States currently has the largest defense budget in the world, and is the largest employer in the world. The military budget funds the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The amount of funding that goes towards the Department of Defense is heavily criticized by Democrats in the United States, because they believe that the funding should be more evenly distributed towards other social welfare programs such as public health insurance and education. 
 In 2018, there were around 5,084 choking deaths in the United States. Death from choking is more common among the elderly with food most often responsible for such incidents. The use of abdominal thrusts, of the Heimlich Maneuver, is suggested to dislodge objects and prevent suffocation. Death from choking In the United States, the odds of one dying from choking on food is around 1 in 2,696. These odds are greater than the odds of dying from an accidental gun discharge or as a passenger on a plane. In 2018, there were around 1.6 deaths from choking per 100,000 population.Choking among children Choking is also hazardous among young children. Young children are not only in danger of choking on food, but also of choking on small objects, such as toys with small parts. Choking, strangulation, or suffocation are the leading reasons for the recall of children’s products in the United States. The other most common reasons for such recalls include the danger of bodily harm and risk of flammability, burn or electric shock. 
 As of January 2019, China ranked first with around 802 million internet users while India achieved second place with 560 million internet users. China and India were not only leading within the Asia Pacific region, but also worldwide. The Asia Pacific region had the largest number of internet users worldwide, reaching nearly 2.1 billion in 2018. However, internet penetration in Asia was still below global average in that year.Internet usage in the Asia Pacific When it comes to the demographic of Asia Pacific’s internet users, the region has more male than female internet users. Individuals in the Asia Pacific region spent about 150 minutes on using the internet daily with figures also indicating that more than half of the time was spent on mobile devices instead of desktop devices. Mobile internet has been an area which has undergone a strong development across the globe in recent years. Mobile internet penetration in the Asia Pacific region was at 45 percent in 2018 and was forecasted to reach 62 percent by 2025. This had a significant impact on mobile commerce and mobile advertising in the region where e-commerce conversion of app transactions was highest compared to desktop and mobile web transactions.
