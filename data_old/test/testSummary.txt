Here, the average retail price of electricity was at 10.58 cents per kilowatt hour in 2018. A ranking of the largest electric utilities companies in the United States can be found here as well as a ranking of global electricity prices in select countries. Retail electricity prices in the United States When Thomas A. Edison developed a system to generate and distribute electricity in order to market his greatest creation, the electric light bulb, he would have known little about the dramatic impact his invention would create on civilization 130 years after the inauguration of the world’s first power station on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York. In 21st century America, electric power is omnipresent in peoples’ lives, as electricity is powering our factories, shops, homes - and even cars. It goes without saying that electricity consumption has to be paid for, and, naturally, people are worried about the size of their electricity bill. On average, retail electricity prices in the United States changed little from 9.90 cents per kilowatt hour in 2011 to 10.58 cents per kilowatt hour in 2017. However, while power rates in the industrial and commercial sectors increased only moderately between 2011 and 2017, residential electricity customers were charged 12.9 cents per kilowatt hour in 2016, up from 11.72 cents per kilowatt hour in 2011. The rising prices are justified by the costs of power production and power grid maintenance. Although the production cost of electricity generated from coal, natural gas and nuclear sources remained relatively flat, the integration of renewable energy sources, investments in smart grid technologies, growing peak demand and power blackouts caused by the vicissitudes of nature continued to trouble the electric utility industry in the recent past. The rates of U.S. electricity prices can also vary widely, with Hawaii residents experiencing some of the highest rates in the country.

 Inflation in Argentina was 34 percent in 2018, expected to rise to nearly 44 percent the following year before declining to 6 percent by 2024. A major factor in this is the legacy of poor fiscal discipline left by the economic depression from 1998 to 2002. What causes inflation? Inflation is a rise in price levels for all goods. Major causes of inflation include an increase in money supply, low central bank interest rates, and expectation of inflation. In a country such as Argentina, the expectation can be one of the biggest obstacles. People expect inflation to be high and demand increasing wages, and firms continue raising prices because they expect the costs of inputs to increase. Banks follow suit, charging high interest rates on fixed deposits. Effects of inflation Inflation negatively affects savers. 100 Argentinian pesos in 2018 will be worth just under 75 pesos in 2019, after adjusting for the 34 percent inflation rate. Similarly, frequently changing prices has its own inherent cost, called “menu cost” after the price of printing new menus. Inflation will also have a positive effect on national debt when that debt is denominated in Argentinian pesos, because the pesos will be cheaper when the loan matures. However, the majority of Argentina’s debts are in foreign currency, which means that inflation will make these debts larger in peso terms.

 Today, the vast majority of the world uses what is known as the Gregorian calendar, Named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in 1582. The Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian calendar, which had been the most used calendar in Europe until this point. The Gregorian calendar lasts for approximately 365.24 days; this means that most years have 365 days, with one extra day being added every fourth year, unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400 (for example, the year 2000 was a leap year, whereas 2100 and 2200 will not be). Ancient Calendars Ancient American and Asian civilizations focused more on cycles of years (such as the Chinese Zodiac), rather than recording centuries or millennia, therefore it is sometimes difficult to translate older calendars into modern terms. For example, the Mayan calendar did not develop in the same way as the Eurasian calendars, and cannot be included with this data, as January 1st, 2020 is written as '13.0.7.2.7'. However, historians agree that by 1CE (in the Gregorian calendar) the majority of civilizations had realized that one year lasted for approximately 365.25 days, and most of the more modern calendars split each year into twelve months. The major differences between each calendar was the starting points of the year and months, with some beginning with the arrival of spring, therefore having no fixed date, and the addition of leap years varied across all civilizations. Revolutionary changes The most recent calendar included here is the French Revolutionary Calendar, which was an attempt to further abandon the 'Ancien Régime' by decimalizing time and restructuring the calendar into twelve months of thirty days, with five or six holiday days left over. The calendar became official in 1793, and was implemented across France and French-occupied areas of Europe, but it was then abandoned after just twelve years. In more recent times, there have been some campaigns to create a new, universal calendar, however the Gregorian calendar has proven again too difficult to replace, having itself become universally adopted, while the other surviving calendars are used mostly for ceremonial purposes.

 Temperature anomalies provide the difference from an average or baseline temperature. Positive anomalies show that the observed temperature was warmer than the baseline, whereas a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was lower than baseline. Since the 1980s, annual temperature departure from the 20th century has been consistently positive. In 2019, the land and ocean surface temperature anomaly stood at 0.95 Celsius. Temperature anomalies are generally more important in the study of climate change than absolute temperature. This is because when calculating average absolute temperatures, factors like station location and elevation may have critical impacts on absolute temperatures, but be less significant in anomaly calculations. A warming planet The past years were the warmest years on record, where warming was driven largely by increased emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Climate change is also evident in the warming ocean surface temperatures as well as the extent of sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere, which usually reaches its peak in December. Weather dynamics can affect regional temperatures and thus, the level of warming can vary around the world. For example, warming trends are most obvious in the Arctic region with the continued loss of sea ice.

Also, more than half of the population lives in urban areas, due to better employment opportunities and services options. The most populous city in Russia is Moscow, followed by St. Petersburg. Because more than 71 percent of the Russian population is between 15 and 64 years old, it is advantageous to live in a big, industrialized city in order to obtain jobs. Russia has one of the lowest unemployment rates in comparison to major industrial and emerging countries, and most of its workforce is employed in the industry and services sector, which are mainly located near or in urban areas as well.

Following the nuclear accident in Japan in March 2011, four reactors at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were shut down permanently. In total, there were seven permanent shutdowns in 2018. Reaction to Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear DisasterGlobally, nuclear power plants have a capacity totaling over 396.9 gigawatts as of 2018. In 2018, there were seven permanent nuclear reactor shutdowns that occurred around the world. Many of these shutdowns were in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster which occurred when an earthquake and a tsunami struck the region on March 11, 2011, causing equipment failure and three nuclear meltdowns. This was the second event after the Chernobyl disaster that was classified as a Level 7 event by the International Nuclear Event Scale, which communicates important safety information of nuclear accidents. The disaster prompted much of the public to lose confidence in nuclear energy and question its safety. Afterwards, many countries accelerated their plans for nuclear power plant shutdowns.

American patriotism 81 percent of the American population seems to be very to extremely proud to be American, and they aren't shy to show it off: Around 60 percent of the population owns an American flag and around 44 percent own apparel branding patriotic imagery or symbols. Interestingly, patriotism seems to span the generations as well, with Millennials being only slightly less patriotic than the Gen X'ers or even the Baby Boomers. Ingrained patriotism is also one of the reasons why so many American men have chosen to fight in wars throughout history, and more than 80 percent of adults between the ages of 85 and 90 are now veterans. The number of veteran men under age 55 is noticeably lower, by the way, even though patriotism is alive and well and the U.S. is still sending soldiers to war zones. While Americans are overwhelmingly proud to be American, it is also worthwhile to see how the public opinion of the United States varies across different regions and countries of the world: While the United States enjoys a fairly favorable standing in Africa, for example, only a third of the Middle Eastern population views the United States favorably, most likely due to its controversial military involvement in the region.

India’s GDP growth is expected to remain steady at more than 7 percent for the next few years, which is almost double that of the global GDP, and both GDP and GDP per capita are expected to increase significantly. Almost half of India’s workforce is employed in the agricultural sector, but services and industry share the other half quite equally. India’s GDP is mostly generated by the services sector, which includes transport, retailing, and offering services in the hospitality and tourism industry. India’s trade balance has been in the red for a decade now, but seems to recover slowly. A trade deficit usually means that a country’s import costs are higher than the amount of money generated with exporting goods. India’s imports could not be compensated for by the country’s exports, as imports have been consistently, even if only slightly, higher over the years both in terms of volume and value. Still, all signs point to India’s economy growing and thriving, reducing India’s debt (as seen above) and unemployment rate, enabling the inhabitants to create a better life for themselves.

The growth of crowdfunding platforms Crowdfunding or crowd sourcing is the collective effort of a number of individuals who pool together resources, usually online, in order to support the efforts of individuals or organizations wishing to get their project off the ground. After the launch of ArtistShare, the site that is often billed as being the first crowdfunding site, the growth in the number of platforms has been constant. The trends began to show in the United States towards the mid-2000s and then in Europe. The increase in the funding volume increases over the past few years are a clear sign of the developing prevalence of this method and raises some interesting questions over the true extent of its potential. In the world after the 2008 economic crisis, a world of fragile and uncertain growth and austerity, it has been proven that it is often extremely difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to procure capital loans from banks. This driver of economic growth is, at least to some extent, being helped along by those who support crowdfunding campaigns online.

US nuclear refueling outage days America’s electricity needs are met by a selection of energy carriers including coal, oil and natural gas, as well as nuclear fuel and renewable energy sources. Despite the wide variety of fuels that can be used, the country’s power generation structure consists primarily of coal and nuclear power to provide its citizens with an around-the-clock “baseload” supply of electricity – this is what makes nuclear power an essential and crucial element of the U.S. power generation mix. In spring and fall, when demand for electricity is lowest, a limited number of nuclear reactors are shut down for refueling and maintenance. Since spent fuel rods are no longer useful in sustaining a nuclear reaction, nuclear units are required to dispose of some of the spent fuel rods and conduct other routine maintenance and repair activities. The level of outage days at operational nuclear power plants in the United States dramatically decreased in the 1990s, when plants reduced the number of refueling outage days from 81 in 1997 to 40 in 1999.

 This statistic shows the regional distribution of the population in China in 2018. That year, approximately 75.6 million people lived in Hebei province in China. Regional differences in China China is the world’s most populous country, with an exceptional economic growth momentum. The country can be roughly divided into three regions: Western, Eastern, and Central China. Western China covers the most remote regions from the sea. It also has the highest proportion of minority population and the lowest levels of economic output. Eastern China, on the other hand, enjoys a high level of economic development and international corporations. Central China lags far behind in comparison to the booming coastal regions. In order to accelerate the economic development of Western and Central Chinese regions, the PRC government has ramped up several incentive plans such as ‘Rise of Central China’ and ‘China Western Development’. Economic power of different provinces When observed individually, some provinces could stand an international comparison. Jiangxi province, for example, a medium-sized Chinese province, had a larger population than the Ukraine or Argentina in 2018. That year, the GDP of Zhejiang, an eastern coastal province, even exceeded the economic output of Sweden. In terms of per capita annual income, the municipality of Shanghai reached a level close to that of South Africa.

 Production of natural gas in the United States has been increasing for the past decade and amounted to 831.8 billion cubic meters in 2018. An increase in production corresponded with rising demand for natural gas in the United States, particularly after the 2008 Recession. Natural gas becomes competitive Since the early 2000s, the price of coal had been going up, and increased more rapidly following the 2008 Recession, which affected the cost of crude oil to an even greater degree. When the price of crude oil peaked shortly after the financial crisis, consumption of petroleum decreased in the next year. Simultaneously, the cost of natural gas dramatically decreased, making it a stronger competitor with coal and petroleum. The rise of fracking Low-interest rates during the Recession led to new investments in new techniques to obtain natural gas, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, that may be controversial due to health and environmental impacts. Often obtained through fracking, shale gas has become a common form of natural gas, and shale gas production in the United States has increased dramatically since the financial crisis.

That year, approximately three people were living in an average Chinese household.Average number of people per household in China – additional information A household is commonly defined as one person living alone or a group of people living together and sharing certain living accommodations. The average number of people living in one household in China dropped from 3.5 in 1990 to 2.87 in 2011. Since 2011, the figure was more or less stable and ranged between 2.87 and 3.17 people per household. The average Chinese household still counts as rather large in comparison to other industrial countries. In 2019, an average American household consisted of only 2.52 people. Comparable figures have already been reached in the bigger cities and coastal areas of China, but in the rural provinces the household size is still much larger. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the household size in China was diametrically correlated to its income. The receding size of Chinese households may be linked to the controversial one-child policy introduced in 1979. The main aim of the policy was to control population growth. In 2017, the fertility rate in China resided at 1.6 children per woman, much less than in the United States or in the United Kingdom. A partial ease in the one-child policy was introduced in 2013, due to which couples where at least one parent was an only child were allowed to have a second child.

 This statistic shows the 20 countries* with the highest infant mortality rate in 2017. An estimated 110.6 infants per 1,000 live births died in the first year of life in Afghanistan in 2017. Infant and child mortality Infant mortality usually refers to the death of children younger than one year. Child mortality, which is often used synonymously with infant mortality, is the death of children younger than five. Among the main causes are pneumonia, diarrhea – which causes dehydration – and infections in newborns, with malnutrition also posing a severe problem. As can be seen above, most countries with a high infant mortality rate are developing countries or emerging countries, most of which are located in Africa. Good health care and hygiene are crucial in reducing child mortality; among the countries with the lowest infant mortality rate are exclusively developed countries, whose inhabitants usually have access to clean water and comprehensive health care. Access to vaccinations, antibiotics and a balanced nutrition also help reducing child mortality in these regions. In some countries, infants are killed if they turn out to be of a certain gender. India, for example, is known as a country where a lot of girls are aborted or killed right after birth, as they are considered to be too expensive for poorer families, who traditionally have to pay a costly dowry on the girl’s wedding day. Interestingly, the global mortality rate among boys is higher than that for girls, which could be due to the fact that more male infants are actually born than female ones. Other theories include a stronger immune system in girls, or more premature births among boys.

In the same year, the youngest murder offender was between the ages of one and four, and there were 93 murder offenders over the age of 75. Murder rate in the United States Despite some feeling that violent crime in the United States is on the rise, perhaps due to sensationalized media coverage, the murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate has declined steeply since 1990. The murder rate has risen some since 2014, but it is nowhere near its peak in 1991. Murder victims in the U.S. The figures for the number of murder victims were similar to those of offenders in 2018.

Within the desktop computer industry, the company is one of the leading PC vendors in the world, next to Hewlett Packard and Lenovo. The company’s primary focus has rested on the development and sale of personal computers and other personal computer-related services, but recent years have seen the company expand into storage and networking markets and begin to place greater focus on the delivery of enterprise hardware and services. Founded back in 1980s by the then 19-year-old Michael Dell, the company has been generating multi-billion dollar revenue figures since the late 90s and also records a generous annual net income. The company also invests a significant amount of funding into research and development, helping the company remain at the top of its game. Throughout the company’s history, Dell has made a number of acquisitions to support its market position, including: Alienware, Perot Systems, Credant Technologies, Gale Technologies, and Quest software. In recent years, two significant events have occurred. Firstly, 2013 saw the company delist its shares from various stock exchanges, becoming a private company.

EMC has generated more than 20 billion U.S. dollars in revenue over the last five fiscal years and around 2 billion U.S. dollars in income. Dell has previously been recognized for its commitment to environmental and sustainability goals. The company ranked well in the 2012 Greenpeace eco-friendly rankings under the category of PC, mobile phone and consumer electronics manufacturers, although it has slipped from the table in recent years. The company has also had a product recycling goal in place since 2006 which works to recover and recycle IT equipment.

This number sums up to 10,265 murders by firearm. The ranking of the most dangerous cities in the world based on murder rate per capita can be accessed here. 
Which player has the most triple doubles? Oscar Robertson - nicknamed ‘The Big O’, is the all-time leader in triple doubles in the National Basketball Assocation. He compiled 181 triple doubles during his playing career with the Cincinnati Royals and the Milwaukee Bucks (1960 to 1974). The highest ranked active player is Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder with 144 triple doubles in second place. What is a triple double? In the National Basketball Association statistical categories are kept on a per game basis for each individual player including points, rebounds, assists and steals. When a player reaches a score of ten or more in at least three of these statistical categories in a game, he records a triple double (e.g. 10 points, 10 assists, 10 rebounds). All the players on the list with at least 100 triple doubles in their career are versatile, strong, and athletic guards able to handle the ball on the offensive end. This enables these players to score at a high level and assist on many other baskets. Their size and basketball smarts often also make them good rebounders. 
 The statistic shows GDP per capita in the United Kingdom from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, GDP per capita in the United Kingdom was at around 42,579.82 US dollars. The same year, the total UK population amounted to about 64.6 million people. The United Kingdom is among the leading countries in a world GDP ranking.Falling unemployment in a time of recession GDP is a useful indicator when it comes to measuring the state of a nation’s economy. GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a year. GDP per capita equals exactly the GDI (gross domestic income) per capita and is not a measure of an individual’s personal income. As can be seen clearly in the statistic, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the United Kingdom is beginning to increase, albeit not to pre-recession levels. The UK is beginning to see signs of an economic recovery, though as of yet it remains unclear what sort of recovery this is. Questions have been raised as to whether the growth being seen is the right sort of growth for a well balanced recovery across the necessary sectors. An interesting oddity occurred in the United Kingdom for nine months in 2012, which saw a decreasing unemployment occurring at the same time as dip in nationwide economic productivity. This seems like good - if not unusual - news, but could be indicative of people entering part-time employment. It could also suggest that labor productivity is falling, meaning that the UK would be less competitive as a nation. The figures continue to rise, however, with an increase in employment in the private sector. With the rate of inflation in the UK impacting everyone’s daily lives, it is becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable groups to maintain a decent standard of living.

Population of South Korea South Korea, also called Republic of Korea, has one of the highest population densities worldwide, i.e. a very high number of inhabitants per square kilometer. However, this does not equal bad standard of living; on the Human Development Index, which ranks countries by their level of living standards using key factors, such as unemployment rate, literacy rate, fertility and mortality rates, etc., South Korea is among the highest-ranked countries. When looking at the aforementioned key factors, South Korea indeed seems to offer a fairly stable environment for its inhabitants, economically and demographically: The country’s unemployment rate has been relatively steady for the past decade, its gross domestic product (GDP) is constantly increasing, and it is among the countries with the highest trade surplus worldwide. As for standard of living, life expectancy at birth in South Korea is among the highest worldwide – South Korea is even mentioned in a recent ranking of the best birthplaces for children. Despite the high population density, South Korea is now one of the countries with the lowest fertility rates, i.e. the number of babies born by women of childbearing age. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by a high number of immigrants coupled with the aforementioned high life expectancy.

 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Nicaragua from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Nicaragua amounted to about 4.97 percent compared to the previous year. Nicaragua's economy Nicaragua’s inflation rate has been on the decline since 2011, but it is expected to rise again in 2016. In 2011, the country's economy experienced higher than average annual growth, which most likely helped increase consumer confidence and may have correlated with a decrease in the inflation rate. In general, consumer confidence is rising because GDP per capita has also been increasing steadily and is expected to continue to do so in the future. However, living conditions of Nicaraguans are still far from ideal, and the country struggles to overcome its reputation as one of the poorest nations in the region. GDP per capita in Nicaragua remained under 2,000 U.S. dollars per capita in 2014; only a fraction of GDP for Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole, which was slightly over 10,000 U.S. dollars per capita that same year. Yet, while per capita GDP is low, the country reports average unemployment and typically, when unemployment is low, consumer confidence increases and prices rise. However, it is likely that any increase in inflation will still have a significant effect on the poor, even if GDP rises.

 In 2018, Trentino-South Tyrol was the region in Italy with the highest birth rate nationwide, with nine births per every 1,000 inhabitants. The following three positions of the ranking were occupied by Southern regions: Campania, Sicily, and Calabria. Indeed, South-Italy was the macro-region with the largest birth-rate in Italy. Population change in Italy Over the last years, the natural increase in population dropped and the number of deaths exceeded the number of births. This phenomenon can be observed in every region of the country, except in Trentino-South Tyrol, the only area in which the number of births was slightly higher than those of deaths in 2018. Consequently, on a national scale the share of people aged over 65 years and over grew constantly, whereas the young population declined over the last decade. Certainly, the median age is increasing as well. Between 2011 and 2018, the average median age ranged from 43.6 years to 45.2 years. High lifespans for Italians Another factor that contributes in making the population older is that people are living longer than ever before. Data about life expectancy reveal that the expected lifespan at birth is steadily rising: in 2018, it stood at 80.8 years for men and 85.2 years for women. In fact, lifespans in Italy are one of the highest worldwide, even above the European average.

How many pubs are there in the UK? There were approximately 47,600 pubs operating in the United Kingdom in 2018. This represented a decrease of approximately 7,200 pubs in the last ten years, and over 13,200 pubs since 2000. Pubs in decline Several factors have been suggested for the decline in pubs in the UK. Public houses, once considered an important pillar of British communities, have faced several challenges related to changing consumer behavior. The 2007 indoor smoking ban and rising alcohol prices deterred people from drinking in pubs, sparking a trend in ‘pre-loading’ on cheap supermarket-bought alcohol before going out. Socializing at home has also become more common place thanks to developments in technology and home entertainment. Not to mention younger generations are drinking less, with more 16-24-year olds choosing to not drink alcohol at all. New trends continue to attract pub goers Although many businesses have succumbed to closure, the nation’s pub culture is still thriving, albeit in different ways. The popularity of pubs for eating out has resulted in many businesses increasing their food offering and taking advantage of new drinking trends such as craft and non-alcoholic beers. Independent pubs, although having a seemingly higher risk of closure, have in fact increased in number: there were around 4,550 more independently owned pubs in the UK in 2017 than ten years earlier. This may be due in part to the emergence of micro-breweries, and consumers becoming more sophisticated in their tastes, preferring to visit traditional pubs or other independents which cater to more sophisticated tastes than the larger pub chains. Independently owned pubs still make up the largest proportion of pubs in the UK, the rest being managed, tenanted or leased by a brewer or pub company.

Love appears to be an important area of life at a young age, with more than 50 percent of young French people stating that love relationships were important for them. First love experiences Even though new technologies and smartphones may have changed the way teenagers live their love life, it seems that the age for first love and sex experiences has not really changed over the years. From 2014 to 2017, the median age at first sexual intercourse remained at 17 years, regardless of gender. But before experiencing love with a partner, teenagers first discover their sexuality alone or through pornographic movies. Most teenagers were aged 13 to 14 years the first time they masturbated, whereas the majority of young French people were between 14 and 15 years old when they watched a porno movie for the first time. A change in sexual practices Easy access to porn from the Internet might has an influence on the way young adults see their sexuality.

Among the top brands Due to its incredible market value, people have already begun dubbing Tesla, GM, and Ford the "New Big Three". In January 2020, the American automotive company's market value climbed above 100 billion U.S. dollars. The rise in Tesla's market value was in large part due to its top selling Model 3. The number of Tesla vehicles delivered worldwide has soared since the release of the Model 3 in Q3 2017, and Tesla delivered a whopping 92,550 Model 3 units in the fourth quarter of 2019. Financial figures In its 2018 fiscal year, Tesla generated 17.6 billion U.S. dollars in revenue from car sales, while the remaining 17.8 percent of revenue came from services, leasing, and others. That year, the company's overall revenue doubled compared with 2017. Despite its revenue growth, Tesla Inc.'s net loss in 2018 came to around 388 million U.S. dollars. Many shareholders see this as a sign of the company's increased investments into innovative new models and production ramp-up. 
 Nigeria’s inflation has been higher than the average for African and Sub-Saharan countries for years now, and even exceeded 16 percent in 2017 – and a real, significant decrease is nowhere in sight. The bigger problem is its unsteadiness, however: An inflation rate that is bouncing all over the place, like this one, is usually a sign of a struggling economy, causing prices to fluctuate, and unemployment and poverty to increase. Nigeria’s economy - a so-called “mixed economy”, which means the market economy is at least in part regulated by the state – is not entirely in bad shape, though. More than half of its GDP is generated by the services sector, namely telecommunications and finances, and the country derives a significant share of its state revenues from oil. Because it got high To simplify: When the inflation rate rises, so do prices, and consequently banks raise their interest rates as well to cope and maintain their profit margin. Higher interest rates often cause unemployment to rise. In certain scenarios, rising prices can also mean more panicky spending and consumption among end users, causing debt and poverty. The extreme version of this is called hyperinflation: A rapid increase of prices that is out of control and leads to bankruptcies en masse, devaluation of money and subsequently a currency reform, among other things. But does that mean that low inflation is better? Maybe, but only to a certain degree; the ECB, for example, aspires to maintain an inflation rate of about two percent so as to keep the economy stable. As soon as we reach deflation territory, however, things are starting to look grim again. The best course is a stable inflation rate, to avoid uncertainty and rash actions. Nigeria today Nigeria is one of the countries with the largest populations worldwide and also the largest economy in Africa, with its economy growing rapidly after a slump in the aforementioned year 2017. It is slated to be one of the countries with the highest economic growth over the next few decades. Demographic key indicators, like infant mortality rate, fertility rate, and the median age of the population, all point towards a bright future. Additionally, the country seems to make big leaps forward in manufacturing and technological developments, and boasts huge natural resources, including natural gas. All in all, Nigeria and its inflation seem to be on the upswing – or on the path to stabilization, as it were.
